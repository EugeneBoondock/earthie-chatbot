====================================================================================================
Dear Earth 2® Users,



We hope all is well.&nbsp;A few hours ago we quietly pushed out our new React front end framework for the entire Earth 2® app interface.&nbsp;While the changes are not so visually recognisable, the update is significant, involving months of work.&nbsp;The benefits are incredibly important since it will help us avoid accruing excessive technical debt, which is what we&#8217;ve been facing while using Riot.&nbsp;Basically this means we can roll out and pivot on features faster that are more secure and require less maintenance.



The update to React is large and we ask you to be patient as we identify and stabilise any issues that may arise.&nbsp;Our internal QA team have been focusing on final tests for this roll out over the past week but due to some unknown changes between our pre-production and production environments there are a number of issues we have been actively working to resolve. The Earth 2® Community Management team are also monitoring socials to report bugs back to our DEV teams, so by reporting issues through such avenues you are helping us to locate and fix problems faster &#8211; thank you.



This React update is major and needed to go live to be monitored and stabilised before any significant Phase 2 features are released.&nbsp;We have also opted to push an initial Phase 2 feature, called Jewels, out alongside the React update. This is to get the ball rolling on Phase 2.&nbsp;If all goes according to plan we will look to release the following planned Phase 2 feature in 2-3 weeks.



Jewels



Jewels may appear on user owned properties randomly and will have a limited amount of time to be claimed before they disappear.&nbsp;Jewels can be used by users to tweak and optimise ongoing yield and functionality of their property, production, and much more in the near future.&nbsp;



The initial spawned Jewels will give an indication of their special ability throughout Phase 2, however, Jewels will soon be able to be destroyed creating shards which can then be crafted, merged, and combined to discover new and potentially rare Jewels with additional benefits &#8211; so hold onto as many Jewels as you can claim!&nbsp;We’ll also launch a Bazaar to allow users the ability to trade their Jewels.



Creativity &#8211; Opening Doors



Creativity is incredibly important for Earth 2® and while we are certainly focused on creating strong foundations, we cannot be so bold as to claim that we should be the only creative minds participating in what Earth 2® will become.



Our vision has always been to make Earth 2® a platform that allows user-generated content, concepts, and ideas to be readily available in addition to the foundations and games we release.



Therefore, we are excited to announce Earth 2® will soon begin creating an official API suite, which we hope will then be followed by an SDK. This will allow us to welcome creativity, ideas, games, and more from creators all over the world. The creation of an API suite can only become a reality after better stability in commercial, technical, and support aspects are achieved. This is something we have worked hard to build over the past 6 months &#8211; and we feel we are very close to achieving.



We expect many interesting ideas and opportunities to become available to our Earth 2® users and aim to have the initial Earth 2® API suite ready by late 2021.&nbsp;We eagerly welcome community engagement on API requests for the first version.



The ideas and possibilities are limitless and we cannot wait to see what people create and plug into Earth 2®!



Lastly, we are close to finalising an acquisition that will not only assist in the technical requirements and progress toward Phase 3, but allow us to create the first official example of a PvP game linked into the Earth 2® platform!



This particular game may be some months away but we are super excited to be working on it until the release. We plan to showcase this as a pioneering project that will help us realise and create the foundations for the initial API and SDK plans.



Next Steps



For now we are focused on ensuring our new React framework operates effectively and fixing any issues that are presented from the upgrade. The development will focus heavily on Phase 2 feature releases moving forward. Holobuildings are coming as is Essence&#8230; and maybe E-ther.

Title: Bazaar
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/07/23/bazaar/

====================================================================================================
Dear Earth 2® users,



We hope all is well.&nbsp;Earth 2® has two roll outs planned for this week, one due to launch over the next 12 hours (so long as a last minute security bug is fixed) and another towards the end of the week.&nbsp;These updates have been made possible due to the hard work and dedication from the Earth 2® development team who have managed the React update with great success.&nbsp;



This is a short announcement to cover some of the updates in the first roll out but you can expect a more detailed, official PR announcement covering deeper details at the end of the week.&nbsp;



The first includes significant updates to our KYC verification process.&nbsp;This includes a new automated process meaning users will receive confirmation of their verification in a much more timely manner. The process will also reduce the existence of incomplete verification requests – something that frustrated a number of Earth 2® users.



Earth 2® users will also be required to verify their accounts before being able to trade goods from user to user.&nbsp;This is a significant and important step toward creating a safer platform capable of expanding to allow compliant transactions between two users wishing to trade goods, whether they be Jewels, Land, Resources or more.&nbsp;Users who do not wish to trade will still be able to purchase new land from us without verifying their Earth 2® account.



The second part of the first roll out is the Earth 2® Bazaar and is the first version of the new Earth 2® user to user trading system.&nbsp;Whole Jewels will be the first sellable item on the Bazaar and will be used as a test, paving the way for additional items to be added as they are released and become tradeable inside Earth 2®.



We ask for your patience and understanding during this process and the following days as our QA and Development team monitor for potential issues. As always, reporting issues to us helps our team to faster identify and resolve problems and we greatly appreciate each and every report we receive.



We look forward to sharing more later this week if all runs smoothly and according to plan.



Thank you

Title: Mentars, E-ther, Essence &amp; Holo Buildings
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/08/12/mentars-e-ther-essence/

====================================================================================================




Dear Earth 2® Players, Followers &amp; Spectators,



We hope all is well. The Earth 2® team has been very busy over the past few months most recently resulting in 7 releases over the past 8 weeks, some noticeable and others less noticeable. These updates have been primarily focused on Phase 2 features which are both relevant in Earth 2®’s long-term plans and which focus on rewarding Players who own land, are creative or remain active. A few days ago the most recent update saw the introduction of Mentars, E-ther and Essence to Earth 2®. It is also possible for Players to insert Jewels into designated slots using their Mentar in order to increase Essence yield.



Recent updates have been pushed through for the benefit of our community, however, we realise we can provide additional information surrounding some of these updates and we are providing this note to bring our Players up to speed with some of our released features.



Mentars



The Mentar is a core Earth 2® entity and technological structure which can only manifest and function on virtual land that has been claimed, or is owned, by a Player.&nbsp;Mentars are essential for the gameplay in Earth 2® as they are the only way a Player can presently collect Essence.&nbsp;Mentars are able to detect and harness any E-ther (more on E-ther below) that exists on a Player’s property from time to time and if consumed quickly enough, can convert part of that E-ther into Essence. Mentars are normally the first structure on a Players land and once instantiated will always remain in place so long as that property remains whole and is not subdivided, even if it moves.



Mentars also have the special ability to harness power from Jewels. This is activated when a Player slots a Jewel into the Mentar.&nbsp;The number of available slots on a Mentar is largely determined by the size of the property the Mentar is attached to for now.&nbsp;Slotting Jewels into your Mentar will show a number of positive effects on a Player’s property over time.



E-ther



E-ther is an unstable, difficult to detect and somewhat mysterious matter that spawns from Player-owned properties inside Earth 2®. Theory has it that when virtual land is claimed and a Player’s presence is recorded in the very binary of that land, the land itself commits to improving its own environment to the will of the Player who owns it.&nbsp;E-ther cannot really be captured or stored but can be detected by a Mentar and if consumed quickly enough by that Mentar can convert into the very storable and collectable form of Essence.&nbsp;



Enough is not yet known about E-ther but it would seem that not all E-ther is identical, which is evident in the varying E-ther to Essence yields that typically don’t convert the same amounts.&nbsp;We know that when captured early enough, E-ther always yields some Essence, but never more Essence than E-ther.



Essence



Unlike E-ther, Essence can be collected and stored. Essence is believed to be some kind of a precursor of matter, since by using it a Player will be able to produce resources more or less out of thin air &#8211; yet only from those resources which exist on the Player’s properties.&nbsp;Essence allows a user to reproduce these resources without exploiting them and is the crucial basis for Player property resource production.



There is a common belief that we are yet to learn about the full potential and uses of Essence but for now Essence is highly desirable on Earth 2® and at some point will likely be traded and sold directly between Players.



Jewels



Jewels, which began spawning randomly inside Earth 2® a number of weeks ago, are starting to prove useful by improving the Mentar&#8217;s ability to detect E-ther and convert it into Essence.&nbsp;In general and amongst other things, Jewels can improve the E-ther detection rate, especially on larger properties, where the distance between Mentar and some places on the property is large.



Once the ability to produce Resources from Essence is available, Jewels will also serve a key part in the effectiveness of certain resource production giving proactive Players an even greater yield from their properties.



Meanwhile, the UPG (Unidentifiable Player Group) are working on the technology to craft a sort of higher tier jewels from the lower tier jewels which they are hoping will result in the ability of a more powerful Jewel that surpasses anything that presently seems possible inside Earth 2®.



Holo Buildings



A new level of creativity was recently released inside Earth 2® named Holo Buildings (HBs).&nbsp;This quiet release, which allows Players to create HBs using the Earth 2® developed HB editor, has more to it than meets the eye.



HBs were originally researched and developed to allow Players the ability to plot out future virtual constructions, weighing up size, look, aesthetic feel and more based on the HBs they are able to create blueprints for.



The UPG soon discovered the energy required to place and display a single HB inside Earth 2® could also be used for the benefit of the Player, both now and well into the future, giving more purpose and utility to HBs than originally thought.



Therefore, while HBs present a Player with the ability to visual and display their planned development look and feel on the Property, not to mention a personal expression visible from high above, HBs also serve to create a headstart for Players on the Earth 2® EcoSim.&nbsp;By way of upgrades, a Player can utilise the space inside their deployed HBs for resource storage retrospectively, meaning at the point of the HB deployment and upgrade that date is timestamped in the Earth 2® timeline and will be referenced for resource generation and storage when such becomes available.



HBs could also be used to expedite research and construction times required inside the EcoSim and contribute toward a volume metric cost for Phase 3 buildings and structures. It is even possible that HBs could continue to exist inside a triggerable alternate reality filter that sits inside the futuristic world of Phase 3.



As with most any type of creativity inside Earth 2®, we strongly believe that user generated content should be tradable and sellable so without a doubt those creative users generating amazing HB blueprints will have a place to trade and sell their blueprints in the future, mutually benefiting the Player, Earth 2® and the purchaser simultaneously.



Summary



Our team is working on expanding on the representation of the new features inside our FAQ section which will include more How To guides. If you experience any issues though, our Support has been trained to help you so please reach out at any time.



The features released over the past 8 weeks are building the foundations of Phase 2 and what will follow.&nbsp;We now have the first buildings and the first and central resources in place. We have the Jewels that will begin to play a major role in the Player’s strategic decision making around where your properties&#8217; economic development will lie and we have the Holo Buildings that allow the Player to plan, see and better prepare for exciting future developments.

Title: Earth 2® Set to Launch Unique Property Identifier System
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/09/06/earth-2-set-to-launch-unique-property-identifier-system/

====================================================================================================
The countdown has commenced for Earth 2® Property Locators, or EPLs, available 1pm UTC September 8th, 2021



Sydney, Australia &#8211; September 6, 2021 Virtual Earth platform Earth 2® has announced the September 8th launch of its new property upgrade feature, the EPL. Short for Earth 2® Property Locator, EPL is a global identifier unique to each Earth 2 property. Players can upgrade to further customize their EPL to a unique word or phase, as opposed to the default alphanumeric code. The initial EPLs on offer are premium, meaning they will not require any type of extension or location identifier on the name.



The EPL functions similarly to a URL in that it’s a unique searchable address that allows users to locate a position or experience inside Earth 2®. Each EPL is connected to a specific property deed. Users will have the option to purchase an upgraded EPL with an easy-to-remember acronym, allowing for greater customisation and discoverability. Upgraded EPLs can be bought with E$ or player earned Essence. The parameters for upgraded EPL names will vary based on the size of each property and the class of tiles.&nbsp;



“Earth 2® is launching EPLs specifically to provide our early community members, the Earth 2® visionaries, with an opportunity to secure unique, desirable and discoverable identifiers for their properties.&nbsp;Most of Earth 2’s players have already received bonus $E or in-game play-to-earn Essence which can be used to purchase EPLs but even so, there is no pressure to claim an EPL, it is completely optional” said Earth 2® founder, Shane Isaac&nbsp;



“EPLs offer players an instant connection to properties and experiences, and we envisage the popularity and desirability of EPLs to increase as our platform continues to expand.”



In the future EPLs will require annual renewal fees, and plans are in the works for an open market system where users can buy and sell unique EPLs, since availability is limited.&nbsp;Those purchasing EPLs now would not expect to see any annual fees for at least 24 months and even after that period early buyers can expect a very nominal fee.&nbsp;In addition to the use of EPLs in the economy-driven Phase 2, Phase 3 will further expand their functionality through the upcoming Teleportation System providing significant additional discoverability to properties with short or catchy EPLs on a global scale.&nbsp;



Earth 2® launched Phase 1 of our metaverse vision in late 2020, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade virtual land on Earth 2®’s developing platform. To date, it is the most successful virtual land platform in history having sold more land to more people than any other project worldwide while building a truly diversified, global, engaged community.&nbsp;Phase 2 began rolling out earlier this year with additional gameplay and feature elements consistent with our longer-term goals of a fully-functioning economy and robust metaverse experience. Property in Earth 2® has unique intrinsic value as it is player-owned, both in the real world and the metaverse and is the starting point for all of Earth 2®’s economic and metaverse activities, including play-to-earn virtual rewards, advertisement, blockchain, user generated content tools and many more upcoming developments.&nbsp;







About Earth 2®



Earth 2® is a platform designed to create a futuristic concept of a second earth; a metaverse, between virtual and physical reality in which real-world geolocations on a sectioned map correspond to user generated digital virtual environments.

====================================================================================================
Today we are excited to introduce the humble beginnings of the Earth 2® “Network”.&nbsp;The Earth 2® Network will become the centralised system where information, communication, notifications and more are delivered to our Players on Earth 2®.&nbsp;Anything of relevance to you as a Player will be found inside the Earth 2® Network over time.



Today, the first part of the Earth 2® Network will be released in the form of the communication hub, a place where you can conveniently receive updates on your E-ther detection, spawned Jewels, Bids, Marketplace Updates and more.



Over time the Earth 2® Network will expand to include a fully fledged social media and communication platform, something which has been in production for some time and is drawing closer to release.



We thank you for your support and for joining us on this journey as we piece together the numerous core features necessary to make the Earth 2® platform a robust and successful player driven geo-locational Metaverse.



We appreciate your patience as our team continues to work on numerous other exciting Earth 2® updates and partnerships, many of which we look forward to sharing with you, our Player, soon.

Title: HoloBuildings, Updates and Fixes
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/09/23/holobuildings-updates-and-fixes/

====================================================================================================
(All above HoloBuildings have been uniquely created by Earth 2® Players using the Earth 2® HoloBuilding Editor)



September, 23, 2021 – Today marks the second part of the official release of HoloBuildings on Earth 2®.&nbsp;This release now allows Players to place permanent HoloBuildings on their properties which, in addition to creating more visual appeal, will provide Players with a variety of benefits inside the Earth 2® EcoSim over time. Subsequent releases will allow Players to construct HoloBuildings using Essence and provide a marketplace where Players can sell their HoloBuilding Blueprint designs.



Once constructed, HoloBuildings improve the appearance of a property but also serve as storage space from that point in time.&nbsp;Storage space and volume Space alone will be of value inside Earth 2® throughout Phase 2, Phase 3 and beyond. After the launch of the economic simulation, HoloBuildings will retain their function as extra storage and significantly increase the amount of raw materials and building blocks a Player’s properties can hold.



In addition to the above benefit and again once the economic simulation launches, Players with preconstructed HoloBuildings will have a head start by receiving the option to retrospectively produce or replicate Essence into the maximum number of collective resources that would have been available on that property throughout the period of time since the HoloBuilding was created.&nbsp;



For now, HoloBuildings can be constructed using E$ and we feel the advantages they will provide long term will undoubtedly justify their low construction costs.&nbsp;We do have plans for Essence to be used to construct HoloBuildings and are working on updates to make this available to our Players.&nbsp;We will continue to update Players on further specifics around the benefits of HoloBuildings when details are ready for release.



Other Updates, Fixes and Notes



Various fixes have been made to the previous HoloBuilding Editor



E-ther generated will be collectable the day after its yield, this due to the heatmap update we have planned which will identify high E-ther and Essence production areas (for reasons yet to be disclosed)



The first part of our Bazaar UI redesign is live with the header being updated



The filter on sorting Jewels by price has been fixed



An update to the Mentar design on the grid has been deployed to improve appearance



Options to toggle Adverts, Mentars, Properties and Building views have been added.

Title: Earth 2® &amp; Mapbox HoloBuilding Press Release
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/09/23/earth-2-mapbox-holobuilding-press-release/

====================================================================================================
The Mapbox GL-JS and GL-Draw APIs led system gives players the first tools they need to create, edit and deploy their Earth 2® created HoloBuilding layouts.



Sydney, Australia, September 23rd- Earth 2®, a metaverse platform that aims to provide a one-to-one virtual version of the Earth, has announced the initial rollout of HoloBuildings, allowing players to create and place 3D buildings and structures on their claimed virtual land to customize their properties.&nbsp;



HoloBuildings are much more than just a visual embellishment of a property. They can serve a whole range of functions that help Earth 2® Players run their economies more effectively and more profitably. Depending on how players choose to develop their properties, HoloBuildings can support the creation of additional storage space for resources that exist at the start of the EcoSim. The earlier a respective HoloBuilding construction occurs and the larger it is, the more resources players will have retrospective access to on the respective property once theEcoSim begins. HoloBuildings are also capable of shortening the construction times and lowering the cost for EcoSim storage buildings. In the long run, the advantages of Holobuildings can massively outweigh their costs.







The roll out of HoloBuildings is one part of Earth 2®’s ongoing goal to become the deepest platform for virtual real estate, products and digital economic transactions that represent the real world and real world locations. This expansiveness will eventually lead to a platform filled with user-generated content, concepts, and ideas by players across the world.



“As we’re ramping up and improving all processes we need the right partners to help us achieve our ambitious goals and we&#8217;re extremely pleased to have forged such a close working relationship with Mapbox moving forward,” said Shane Isaac, founder of Earth 2®. “The roll out of HoloBuildings clearly demonstrates our intention to support and promote player creativity by way of user generated content which can not only look good but serves further purpose inside the Earth 2® simulation. We’re thrilled to be providing this next step in HoloBuildings to our players today, while we continue to work internally on our Phase 3, realistic and user-friendly 3D creative editors.”



Virtual land and real estate on Earth 2® holds real-world value and can be traded for actual currency. This is the first step towards creating an economy that will support and sustain Earth 2®’s long term vision.&nbsp;



“Earth 2® is a great example of how our leading-edge location and mapping technologies are leveraged to support a robust metaverse and hyper-connected community. Earth 2® uses our latest satellite imagery, 3D, and our Mapbox Tiling Service (MTS) to process massive amounts of transactional data which is then rendered into HeatMaps across Earth 2®’s entire globe every four hours,” said Peter Sirota, CEO of Mapbox. “Earth 2®’s recent launch of holobuildings enables a powerful user-generated content capability while unleashing an exciting layer of creativity to the community. We look forward to supporting Earth 2® as they continue to innovate and launch new features today and in the future.”&nbsp;

Title: Earth 2 to release Jewel Crafting
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/11/10/earth-2-to-release-jewel-crafting/

====================================================================================================
November 11, 2021 &#8211; Earth 2 is excited to announce the upcoming release of Jewel Crafting.  Jewels will become a central part of the planned Earth 2 EcoSim and will be able to boost, control and specialise the resource production on a Player’s property.&nbsp; Over coming days, Earth 2 will introduce an additional layer to Jewels called Jewel Crafting.&nbsp; Jewel Crafting is a new feature which provides the ability for players to craft their existing Jewels into superior second tier level Jewels that can be tailored toward a market’s needs.



Players will be able to craft stronger Jewels by combining multiple ones together, or shatter them, which generates something called Shards.&nbsp; Shards can then be combined into smaller Jewels of a chosen colour, or, together with Essence, crafted with Jewels you already own to further improve their quality and effect.



In addition to their key part of the EcoSim, Jewels will provide multiple levels of utility in other areas of Earth 2, including the first, soon to be announced, official PvP game. &nbsp; In such games, it will be optional for game creators to set the benefits Jewels release during game play and even whether the Jewel then becomes a consumable, or not.&nbsp;



“In a traditional game such commodities would be sold and distributed directly from the game creator to the player and would not be tradeable between other players on an open market for their value”, said Shane Isaac, founder of Earth 2.&nbsp; “Earth 2 believes in breaking this trend as one of our core long term beliefs is to include players in the entire ecosystem allowing for player involvement and participation in the distribution of game play assets, user generated content and in the future player experiences.&nbsp; Our approach with Jewels feeds into our overall desire to create a player governed, geolocational metaverse and the idea of introducing Jewel spawning on existing Earth 2 properties at an early stage is an initiative to reward our early supporters and land owners”.



A further level of Jewel Crafting is scheduled to be released over coming weeks with each future release unlocking scores of more potential crafting results, a number that will continue to grow on each new release.&nbsp; Crafting will inherently have a deflationary effect on Jewel supply and increase their scarcity which will become more apparent as we continue to officialise our long term plans.



This announcement and release is part of our Earth 2 Anniversary month celebration with more scheduled announcements, surprises and news to come over the duration of November, 2021!



Game Activity



3 weeks ago the first version of the Earth 2 Game Activity feed went live.&nbsp; This feature displays some of the activity occurring on the Earth 2 network at any given time and importantly provides an indication on what players are presently doing on Earth 2.&nbsp; It was created to provide a level of togetherness and transparency.&nbsp; We intend to expand the Game Activity feed with additional types of data as more Earth 2 products are released, including potential filter options.



Players may visit their settings page to activate anonymity if they do not wish to have their public username shown on the Game Activity feed.



Since the September 24 announcement, there have been 5 updates released on Earth 2, the soon to be Jewel Crafting update will make 6.&nbsp; Our October 20 release included some community requested updates and though most of those updates were minor, we received good positive feedback from the community, thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Moving forward, we plan to create a community forum where Players can officially lodge bugs, suggest features and vote on level of importance, and our development team will attempt to integrate more community fixes and improvements where and when possible.&nbsp; This aligns with our long term goal of Earth 2 being a platform that is gradually run by the players.



For your convenience, please see a list of the updated changes approved to be public since our previous September announcement.

Title: Announcement &amp; Retrospective Essence Reward for Earth 2 Land Owners
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/12/03/retrospective-reward-for-earth-2-land-owners/

====================================================================================================
03/DEC/2021



Dear Earth 2 Players,



We hope all is well and that you are keeping safe and healthy.



As we wave goodbye to the end of our maiden year, we want to thank you for your ongoing support for and dedication to Earth 2. Your most recent show of support in the Enter the Metaverse event was truly fantastic to see!



Our one-year anniversary month may have officially ended but we still have exciting news and developments we wish to share with you this month including a new major partnership, new core team members, our tech acquisition and possibly 1 or 2 other technical partnerships we have been working with our existing partners which will actively focus on assisting us build the Earth 2 Phase 3 core technology. In fact, each announcement we plan to make will be a piece of the puzzle that will reveal our big-picture plan for Earth 2. It is not a traditional roadmap, but it will give significant insight into the direction we are heading going into our second year, and beyond. 



While you have been patiently waiting, we have been working diligently to create and implement robust foundations for a sustainable, player-driven ecosystem within our platform, and for our metaverse. Solid foundations are the key to sustainable development that will facilitate exponential growth in Earth 2’s future. This includes expansion and innovation within our platform offerings, as well as user-base growth and diversification, and collaborative services which will holistically enhance the overall E2 metaverse experience.&nbsp;



Since inception, our core vision for Earth 2 as a real-world, geolocation based metaverse that is fully customisable has not changed. In the physical world, an urban environment designed with purpose to support an economically diverse society is key to making a sustainable city where inhabitants are empowered by an adaptive environment that responds to needs and facilitates self-actualisation. This concept applies when creating a metaverse designed to exist in perpetuity. Any successful metaverse is dependent on the quality and range of user activity and we are acutely aware that with proper design, we can succeed in creating a sustainable ecosystem within our platform for our players.Thus, our metaverse will empowers its inhabitants through creation, collaboration, utility, sustainable growth, engagement and player rewards. This announcement details one part of a whole series of components that will come together in realising and strengthening our core metaverse vision.



This vision has been at the forefront of our iterative decision-making processes, and we are very pleased to announce our Essence Distribution Commitment (EDC) and the role it will play going forward. The Essence Distribution Commitment is a promise to reward our existing land owning players an exact number of the minimum Essence they can expect to generate from their properties over time.&nbsp; We are applying the same rule to reward for every property equally depending on which country the properties are purchased in.&nbsp; This EDC will be inherently linked to and reside on every individual Tier 1 founder property (that is all properties purchased before the EDC deployment). This ensures that the players owning a particular property are aligned with the long term goals of Earth 2 and genuinely intend to partake in Essence as a resource of Utility on our platform.&nbsp; The amount of Essence linked to a property will be publicly visible to anyone and we believe that when Essence has an externally determined trading value, this will naturally be linked to the player driven trading price on a property.&nbsp; This is clearly beneficial for all holders of Tier 1 founder properties.&nbsp; Having said that, as a special final bonus to celebrate this day, Earth 2 will instantly release 20% of all Essence held inside the properties directly to the accounts of the current land owner of those properties and the remaining 80% will be made available through existing and future game play. This availability will be sped up for those who more actively partake in various game play features on our platform.



This commitment means that our early adopters, holders and loyal players will receive the first benefits, many of which could be retrospective, of being a part of the Earth 2 community and participating in the progress of our metaverse. This commitment involves a shift in tile hierarchy which will not only bring more value and utility to long term, active players, but attract and facilitate the sustained on-boarding of new players through affordable land ownership options for prospective land owners. The introduction of the “Tier” classification will create depth in the virtual land real estate that will enable a diversified player base which is a crucial factor in the sustainability of our metaverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Beyond that, this commitment is a gesture of our appreciation for our community. Especially those early adopters who have held on tightly with us on this exciting &#8211; sometimes seemingly unpredictable &#8211;&nbsp; roller coaster of a journey that has been our first year. We wanted to reward your dedication and acknowledge the trust our players have put into Earth 2. This promise of Essence is an exclusive gift and we feel its potential value will continue to be realised as we publicise further announcements. Again, this is just a small part of a greater dynamic ecosystem that will enhance the E2 metaverse we envisioned since 2017.



Congratulations to all of our new Tier 1 founder property owners! Once our servers are back online with the update you will be able to progressively see this retrospective bonus gift appear inside your account and your properties over the next 24 hours!&nbsp; If you are experiencing any issues after this period please reach out to:

====================================================================================================
Provides on-chain, non-custodial ownership and transaction capability for Earth2 usersOffers the option to move assets and transactions onto the public Ethereum mainnet&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth 2 and Polygon Studios will collaborate to enhance blockchain gaming and scale metaverse platform



Sydney, Australia &#8211; December 2021.  Earth 2, the metaverse platform and virtual twin of our real world, today announced its decentralization plans and upcoming blockchain deployment to put its digital properties on-chain, and onto the public Ethereum ecosystem using the Polygon protocol and framework. 



Earth 2’s player-owned digital economy has experienced hyper-growth since its late 2020 launch and now, via its decentralization plans, will convert select in-game digital assets to crypto, effectively transferring them to the blockchain.  This will provide immediate value to Earth 2’s community via direct, on-chain, non-custodial ownership of their digital properties with the ability to buy, sell and trade on a permissionless basis without the consent of any 3rd-party. 



Earth 2’s upcoming integration with Polygon’s commit chain solutions also provides its users with increased transaction volumes with predictable costs and settlement times, and the option to move transactions and assets onto the public Ethereum mainnet.  In addition, Earth 2 is partnering with Polygon Studios to scale its platform and create new models to enhance blockchain gaming and metaverse experiences while leveraging Polygon’s full-stack scaling solutions and industry leadership in the use of zk-proofs and rollups.



“Our partnership with Polygon Studios allows Earth 2 to move our platform and community to Web3, enabling direct user ownership and control of digital property, and providing a trustless means for players to accrue real economic value created from their participation in the metaverse” said Shane Isaac, founder and CEO of Earth 2. “Integrating with Polygon will enable reduced gas fees, faster transactions, and a seamless crypto user experience for all Earth 2 users.”



“Collaborating with a metaverse and virtual economy leader like Earth 2 highlights our commitment to the blockchain gaming and NFT ecosystems” said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon.&nbsp; “Our powerful set of tools to scale transactions will enable Earth 2 to continue to innovate, close the gap between Web3 and Web2 gaming, and bring truly novel experiences to their digital economy and beyond”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/12/16/earth-2-announces-acquisition-of-3d-fast-paced-sci-fi-vehicular-combat-game-drone/

====================================================================================================
Sydney, Australia &#8211; &nbsp;December, 2021 &#8211; Earth 2, the metaverse platform and virtual twin of our real world, has announced the acquisition of DRONE The Game (DRONE), a fast-paced 3D-action combat game where players custom build their sci-fi vehicles and player-versus-player environments.&nbsp;



The acquisition will facilitate Earth 2’s first official 3D gameplay implementation through the integration of core components from DRONE’s tech stack, including its advanced arena and vehicle editors, with Earth 2’s metaverse platform.&nbsp;



Along with onboarding DRONE’s core engineering and creative development team, Earth 2 plans to accelerate many aspects of its internal development by leveraging DRONE’s adaptive technology, including its advanced rendering and texturing systems, terrain building tools, real-time lighting and particle systems, networking and backend technologies, procedural modelling and mesh generation systems, plus dynamic AI pathfinding.



“The ultimate goal of this acquisition is direct ownership of innovative world building and gameplay technologies to extend Earth 2’s Metaverse platform.&nbsp; It illustrates our ongoing commitment to invest in our development team, and to acquire technical expertise relevant to delivering Earth 2’s experience to millions of people across the globe,” said Shane Isaac, founder of Earth 2. “User Generated Content and utilizing our community’s creativity is a priority for Earth 2 as we continue to leverage blockchain technology to move our platform to Web 3 in partnership with Polygon Studios.”



Earth 2 is dedicated to continuing the development of DRONE, including its integration into the Earth 2 platform.&nbsp; Further details on how DRONE and its underlying technology will be used inside Earth 2 will be released progressively over the coming months.



DRONE, including its Arena and Vehicle Editor, is available on Steam in its current state, untouched as yet by any Earth 2 updates. We invite our players to download the free trial version if they wish to begin familiarising themselves with the demo but urge people not to purchase the full version just yet as Earth 2 intends to change the price of the game to FREE in the near future.&nbsp;

Title: Gifting of Virtual Land on Earth 2
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2021/12/23/gifting-of-virtual-land-on-earth-2/

====================================================================================================
Dec 23, 2021 &#8211; Just in time for Christmas, Earth 2 has launched its new gifting feature, allowing players the ability to send ownership of unique virtual land tiles of any geolocation on earth.  Virtual land on Earth 2 directly corresponds to exact locations in the real world making each piece of land, including the sole ownership of that land, completely unique.  



What does gifting bring to Earth 2?



The gifting feature will not only make it easier for the welcoming of new players into community driven land projects, such as MegaCities, but also serves as an interesting and different type of gift experience which provides the recipient with direct ownership of land at the starting point of Earth 2’s metaverse, the largest virtual land registry in the world in both size and diversified ownership. 



Earth 2 predicts the metaverse to be a constantly growing and evolving concept, much like the Internet, and with this ongoing expansion, the number of possible use cases and functions for virtual land inside the metaverse will continue to grow.&nbsp;



“Empowering players with more agency over the utility of their land, beyond trading, is a natural progression towards the futuristic, player-driven metaverse envisioned by Earth 2”, said Earth 2 Founder, Shane Isaac.&nbsp; “Irrelevant of the occasion, virtual land makes for a very different, interesting and unique gift, on so many levels.”&nbsp;



Players of Earth 2 have already begun discovering such versatility, with one player taking advantage of the new feature, in his own unique way, to create a virtual memento of the exact location where his engagement proposal took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;



“I proposed in front of thousands of people before watching the Nutcracker at the Lexington Opera House,” said Matt Haydon, an Earth 2 community member who recently shared his special experience publicly online. 



He went on to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m thankful Earth 2 added the gifting option. A few minutes and 1 tile later I&#8217;d frozen a moment in time forever. It&#8217;s a simple way to &#8220;engage&#8221; the recipient and give them a taste of E2. New user or existing, it&#8217;s a nice touch just in time for the holiday season.&#8221;



Pictured (above &amp; below): Newly engaged couple, Matt Haydon and his fiancé. 











Using our new gifting feature to share and immortalise meaningful locations is only one of many varying reasons to give the gift of land to someone.  With our recent introduction of Tier 2 virtual land tiles, a partnership with Polygon Studios and the tech acquisition of DRONE the Game, now is a great time for players to reserve their own piece of the future inside Earth 2. 







Pictured (above &amp; below): Image of the land tile purchased by Matt Haydon and the description of the property. 











How to access the gifting feature:



Gifting is available from one Earth 2 user to another or one Earth 2 user to any valid email address.&nbsp; In the future, gifting will also expand to become available on Earth 2’s own social media platform.



Select the tile/s you wish to purchase and follow the transaction process as normal.&nbsp; Signing up on Earth 2 is free.



Before finalising payment for the selected tiles, select the “This is a Gift” checkbox.&nbsp;



In the space provided, enter either an existing Earth 2 account name or an email address if your giftee is not yet an Earth 2 player.&nbsp;



Continue with the transaction as normal.&nbsp;



Once the transaction is complete, a gift redemption code will be automatically sent to you and your giftee via in-game notifications (existing user) or via email (new user).&nbsp;



The team at Earth 2 loved hearing about the story of Matt’s proposal, if you have a unique story you would like to share with us, post it on our official Earth 2 Community Facebook page, or tag us in our socials!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Title: Web Updates and Happy New Year!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/01/12/web-updates-and-happy-new-year/

====================================================================================================
Dear Earth 2 Players,



We hope all is well and Happy New Year!&nbsp;



We’re a little bit late to the New Year’s party but our team has been working hard on some important fixes and updates over the break.&nbsp; In continuation of the trajectory we were on at the end of 2021, we plan to provide ongoing updates, articles and plans to our players and community as frequently as possible throughout 2022.&nbsp; In addition to the web updates deployed hours ago, you can expect the next tier level of Jewels, a completely revamped bidding system and a short but informative dev vlog to go live over the next few weeks.



The recent web updates include a complete revamp of the header user interface which features more user-friendly map view modes and a repositioned searchbar now located conveniently beside it to keep all map-related features in one location.&nbsp;



The How-To, Support and News buttons have also been added to the main header for easier access when players are logged in, all of which results in more features being available and easy to access by players using mobile devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Some other important updates that have gone live are fixes to the holobuilding editor, with the limit on editable blueprints being removed, keeping the “Clone” and “Delete” action buttons consistently available, and keeping holobuildings in proportion when placed on different land fields to the one they were created on. Tile generation on the editor was also optimised. These changes provide a more enjoyable creative experience for our E2 creators.&nbsp;



Small changes like these, especially the web UI updates, are part of our longer term goal to release the first version of the Earth 2 launcher and allow us to not only release parts of the expected UI of the launcher via our website early, but also test how well that UI is works with a live audience.



Contrary to what some may say, building a metaverse can and should be achieved in smaller steps starting with features that have long term fundamental relevance inside the metaverse. 



Player creativity, trade, gaming, opportunity, ownership, cooperation, rewards and voting are a start and a must, and we will continue to work on setting these smaller foundations in parallel to working on the bigger, long term Phase 3 vision.



Thank you for being part of this journey and a Happy 2022 to you, the most important part of Earth 2!  



Here’s to the beginning of another year moving closer to our goals! 



https://app.earth2.io/#thegrid &#8211; check out the new header UI update



https://earth2.io/updates &#8211; keep up to date with details on this release and others.&nbsp; This being the ‘official’ update number 48.

Title: Tier 3 Jewels add to 1.3m Player sold Jewels to date
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/01/20/tier-3-jewels-add-to-1-3m-player-sold-jewels-to-date/

====================================================================================================
20th of January, 2022, Sydney &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to announce the introduction of Tier 3 Jewels into our evolving EcoSim.  This introduction sees the next level of player crafted jewels released inside Earth 2 and is part of our ongoing commitment to tweak and expand the important economical component of our future metaverse.  Over time, we envision these changes will bring new dimensions to Earth 2 and future gameplay mechanics involving the upcoming Resource release, as well as other aspects, such as PvP. 



The Jewel system was created to introduce gameplay that would foremost serve to benefit its players in play and trade and has been incredibly successful for the Earth 2 community resulting in very healthy user to user trade volumes.&nbsp; In fact, Earth 2 jewel crafters have sold over 1.3 million Jewels to date, inside the Bazaar, for a stable value in fiat of over $1m.&nbsp; These statistics are important as they validate a proof of concept concerning player crafted assets being created and successfully traded inside Earth 2 and we intend on expanding this to include more player crafted or created content that will ideally, where possible, have varying attributes linked to benefits inside the Earth 2 metaverse.



This Jewel release now expands the total number of possible jewels by more than 3 fold, resulting not only in more potential crafting combinations but also slotting strategies for those players who wish to focus on mastering the EcoSim gameplay.



When asked about the reasoning behind the new mechanics, Earth 2 Game Designer, Marco Stano, explained, “With Tier 3 Jewels, I wanted to hand a lot of control over to the player on how much Essence a property yields, which Resources are being produced and what to focus on. What&#8217;s currently happening is that players discern which Jewel is the best and then focus solely on obtaining as many Jewels of that type as possible.”



He revealed, “With Tier 3, we&#8217;re tying them in closer with Resources, which are location dependent. In addition, a lot of Jewels now have an Essence bonus attached to them, increasing [the] options. Thus, the best Jewel for player A might be different for player B; and with Interference in play, you may want to find a working combination of Jewel colors that both maximizes your Essence and Resource yield. A desert property will have a very different optimal combination compared to a forest property, for example, which is a great base for trade.”&nbsp;



This suggests a significant relationship between Tier 3 Jewels, Essence generation and Resource production, meaning players will need to consider using a combination of strategy and luck to optimise the effects of slotting.&nbsp;



Tier 3 Jewels are characterised by a mixed-colour appearance. While not unlike Tier 2 jewels in that these mixed-colour jewels will increase production of multiple Resources without increasing cost, when a property is slotted completely using these crafted, mixed-coloured jewels, Essence production on the property could be boosted by up to double digit percentages.&nbsp;



Tier 3 Jewels differ from Tier 2 Jewels in that not only are there now a multitude of different colour combinations, some coloured jewels can cause interference with other coloured jewels, or even with themselves. Earth 2 players will need to experiment with multiple colours to discover the optimal slotting combinations resulting in another dimension to the game that rewards players who spend time investigating, researching and testing.&nbsp;



In addition to the new mechanics of Tier 3 Jewels, there is a very special and rare jewel that only the very luckiest of players will be able to discover; the Brilliant Jewel. To date, there are only a very small handful of Brilliant Jewels in existence, making it the highest possible quality of jewel a player can aspire to obtain in Earth 2. Brilliant Jewels can boost Essence generation by up to 60%, as well as allow jewels to exist which simultaneously prime Resource production and boost Essence generation. It is important to note that there is no specific “recipe” for crafting a Brilliant Jewel, they are simply a random and ultra-rare occurring variant of the Luminous Jewel.



Furthermore, in conjunction with the launch of the Tier 3 Jewels, Earth 2 has also implemented the following updates to the jewel system:&nbsp;



Black Jewels now only affect oil production;New Anthracite Jewels will affect coal production;Tricolour jewels (Sunset, Sunrise, Jamaica) will increase E-Ther evaporation by 2% on slotted properties;The effectiveness of jewel slotting on properties will be massively increasedTier 1 properties will have a minimum of 5 open jewel slots; andTier 2 properties will now allow players to slot jewels onto their properties with a minimum of 3 open slots.



The new Jewel tier release illustrates our commitment to actively adapt various segments of the Earth 2 EcoSim in order to ensure it is not only interesting but balanced, and our game design team will continue to monitor the actual results of the released updates.  As a result of this particular update, players on Earth 2 can now begin crafting more types of jewels and look forward to discovering how the jewels they craft affect Resource discovery and production on their properties.

Title: Second Egg Hunt Live and Update
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/01/28/second-egg-hunt-live-and-update/

====================================================================================================
January 29, 2022 &#8211; Sydney



The Egg Hunt



Earth 2’s second Egg Hunt is underway, and it’s free for all Earth 2 Players to participate!  All you need is a free Earth 2 account to play!



The Egg Hunt concept was created last year to provide rewards to those Players closely following Earth 2 related posts, videos, images and more.&nbsp; It takes no time away from our core development progress and is a fun way for our community to engage with such updates.&nbsp; It also rewards the most diligent, observant, and quick to react players with the potential to win one of the coveted Eggs and its prize.&nbsp;



Last year, Earth 2 officially announced its upcoming decentralization and blockchain deployment plan. This puts digital properties on-chain and converts certain in-game digital assets to crypto, effectively transferring them to the blockchain. In line with the plan for later this year, winners of this Egg hunt will receive an additional prize in the form of an official Earth 2 NFT Egg.&nbsp; If you were one of the lucky winners or runners-up from the Egg Hunt last year, you will also be awarded an NFT of your egg.



Only a couple of Eggs have been hidden so far but new eggs could be hidden inside anything officially Earth 2 related including posts on our website, social media accounts and possibly even from the E2 founder this time so be sure to keep an eye out for new posts!



Before you get started, here are the rules for this year’s Egg Hunt:&nbsp;



If you find an Egg you MUST SCREENSHOT, CROP and WRITE YOUR NAME on the image. DO NOT submit a screenshot of the full image or it will be disqualified.Post the image to your Twitter, Instagram or Facebook timeline with the hash tag #Earth2EggHunt2022 . The post privacy must be set to public in order to qualify (otherwise our team won&#8217;t be able to discover and validate it).Comment or Reply under this post with your Earth 2 Profile URL so that we can find and verify that you have a valid Earth 2 account. IMPORTANT : Winners will be announced on our Social Media accounts over the following week or once 10 people find an egg.  The announcement will include a list of the date and time the egg was reported. Other Players will then have a period of 5 days to challenge any of the Winners by responding to that post with clear evidence showing they found and reported the egg first. Once that 5 day period has lapsed we will not be reviewing any further challenges and the winners at that point will stay.Once Winners pass the 5 day challenge period successfully they will receive their E$ prizes credited to their Earth 2 accounts. NFT eggs and Earth 2 Profile Eggs will be provided at a later date and in line with releases of relevant blockchain deployments.&nbsp;Any user caught sharing hints or clues for others on where to find an Egg before all Eggs have been claimed will be disqualified.&nbsp;The first person to find an Egg will receive the grand prize for that Egg, as well as the NFT of that Egg. The next 10 runners-up for each egg will also receive an NFT for that egg and E$150.&nbsp;For legal reasons, the E$ received from this challenge can only be spent on the purchasing of land or other in-game items.&nbsp;



Please do not report egg findings directly to Earth 2 Community Managers or ask for validation whether you&#8217;ve found an egg or not. It creates a significant amount of additional work for our Community Management team in particular and most team members are not aware of where the eggs are hidden until days after they are released.



Simply follow the rules and wait until the list of winners is released after which time you will be able to challenge any results you feel are inaccurate.



Update



Hours ago the Earth 2 team also released some updates making it 3 updates and website releases now in 3 weeks.&nbsp; A brief summary of the latest updates include:



T1 tiles now appearing brighter verse T2 tilesbidding events appearing on the game activity feedbackend restrictions to the bounding box of newly selected propertiesgifted properties which remain unclaimed cannot receive bids or be bought, sold or edited until a claim on the property is finalisedoptimisation of property imagesimproved database performance for the Market Placedescription for Bazaar sales being absent in the transaction history when the jewel in question was shatteredimplemented updated reporting mechanisms for in game distribution of resources such as Essence for internal team monitoring and balancing purposesBidding system issues fixed regarding edge cases involving P2P counter offersAuthentication process improved for P2P Jewel trading in the Bazaar

Title: Progress Update on Resources
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/02/09/progress-update-on-resources/

====================================================================================================
February 9, 2022 



Dear Earth 2 Players, 



We hope all is well. Many of our Players have been waiting patiently for Resources to become detectable on Earth 2 and we would like to provide an update on its progress. This update will include details on how the location of Resources will be determined and an indication on what to expect in the lead up to Resources going live.&nbsp;



Resources will become a key part of our EcoSim, which is a critical component of the entire Earth 2 Metaverse and how it functions at an operational level. Trade is a big word which encompasses many things and just like in the real world where most things revolve around trade, so will the EcoSim, and Resources are going to play a massive part in setting the foundations of what we feel will grow into a system of global digital trade with supply, demand and prices being determined by secondary markets. We believe that over time this will ultimately create additional extrinsic value to creations and digitals assets inside, or even associated with, Earth 2.



The basis of our Metaverse is the use of real-world geolocations which provide a familiar link between the virtual and physical reality. Accurately creating this link between the two realities is a highly involved process and something we feel strongly about getting right. Anyone could simply drop random resources onto a map and say ‘voila’, but we have taken our time to meticulously gather and compile extensive real world physical data of resource locations from multiple trusted data sources and programmatically process that data into the virtual land on Earth 2 at a global scale.



But what about if the Earth 2 Resource data doesn’t show the Resources I think I have on my land?



Interaction and collaboration with our Earth 2 Player Community is extremely important to us and as we move toward the decentralisation of Earth 2, we are constantly looking at ways to involve the community in decisions and processes that are important to creating the foundations of what Earth 2 is and what it will become. Therefore, we are presently building a method for our community to manually claim the presence of Resources on their properties should it be missed inside the initial Earth 2 Resource data set.&nbsp;



The purpose of this feature is motivation toward the pursuit of truth and less so for the pursuit of personal gain, however, there will be rewards for Players who accurately report or validate manual claims when the time comes.



Many Earth 2 features released to date are in fact building blocks, or stepping stones, toward bigger features we plan to release in the future that play part of a bigger picture and Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) is one such example.&nbsp;



If Earth 2 Resource data misses a resource a Player feels they have on their property, E2PRV will serve an initial purpose of allowing Players to report the absence of that resource and give other Players the opportunity to validate whether the report is accurate or not. Players who report correctly will receive that resource on their property and Players who validate a correct report will be rewarded with a bonus, yet to be announced, but it will most probably include Essence.



The E2PRV will be limited to a certain period of time, most likely three months, after which Earth 2’s core Resource locations on owned land will be set. Land Owners who wish to report a Resource they believe is on their property will need to supply proof of its existence, as well as pay a “Protective Fee” for each claim and validation made during this period. This will help validators assess their own position and whether they should support your claim or not. The fee will be refunded in full when a claim is successful and exists for the purpose of eliminating unnecessary spam claims so that legitimate claims can be fast-tracked and verified quickly.&nbsp;



A mapping interface for this feature will allow the community to manage and monitor claims in progress (including those rejected and approved) across the globe. Successful claims will be published on that interface and colour-coded according to the type of Resource. Users will also have the ability to vote on open claims if there is particular interest in a certain location or type of Resource. While this will not automatically authenticate the claim, it will help our team to focus efforts on claims that are of higher priority.&nbsp;



Once completed successfully, our plan is to expand E2PRV into other staking, validation and voting systems driven by the community. We are also excited to announce that it is our long term goal to decentralise key Resources from Earth 2 as individual tokens or NFTs, adding a whole new layer of game play and Player determined pricing, supply and demand. As with Essence, there will be an extended period in which Resources will operate centralised inside of Earth 2, providing us with important data to determine and refine the metrics.



We are now in the process of final data checks and the integration of this global Resource data has, so far, been a major procedural and technical undertaking and something that we are working through as effectively as possible. We are looking forward to seeing you reporting and validating Resources on your land by Q2, 2022!



The purpose of this announcement is to provide an update to the Earth 2 Community.&nbsp; Further details and exact processes will be released before the E2PRV goes live.

Title: CUSTOM REFERRAL CODE, LOCKED COUNTRIES &amp; MORE
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/02/10/custom-referral-code-locked-countries-more/

====================================================================================================
February 10, 2022 &#8211; Sydney.



Dear Earth 2 Players,We hope all is well and we’re pleased to bring you a second update in as many days.



Custom Referral Codes for T1 Property Owners



For our EDC Tier 1 property owners, the promised custom referral code benefit has been implemented and is now live! To recap, the referral code benefit includes:



7.5% credit to code owners and 7.5% discount to code users when purchasing new tiles from Earth 2Code customisation function, with a maximum of 15 permissible characters



This was part of the EDC ( https://earth2.io/edc ) promise and we’re thrilled that our T1 property owners can uniquely use their customised referral codes to give and receive bigger discounts and credits to anyone using them!



Locked Countries to be Unlocked



In addition to the Referral Code update, Earth 2 is formally announcing its intention to begin unlocking “locked” countries imminently. This will come as exciting news for many members of the E2 community, particularly those who have been waiting to purchase land in these locked countries for quite some time.&nbsp;



All locked countries will be released with Tier 2 tiles, and will be available for purchase starting at the standard base rate of E$0.10 per tile.&nbsp; Releasing these locked countries has become possible due to the improvements made by our development team in regards to the location data inside the relevant problematic areas.&nbsp; Location data inside these areas is now accurately reflected and we&#8217;re pleased to finally enable Earth 2 Players to take up ownership in those previously locked countries.



It should be duly noted that our team has not forgotten about the Players who own T1 land in locked countries, and out of goodwill, we are working on ways to provide compensation for those Players and their affected T1 properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Additionally, we have decided to stagger the release for all 38 locked countries. There will be no official announcements on when a country will be released and the releases will occur over different time zones to ensure people from all parts of our world get a fair chance.&nbsp;



The biggest change with these releases is that there will now be daily restrictions on how many tiles a user can purchase for a set period of time after a country is officially released.&nbsp; This will not only prevent a small number of Players hoarding early purchases at the best prices but will add more diversity to the ownership of that country, including more diversity to future voting events which we feel very excited about.&nbsp;&nbsp;



With our recent announcement on Resources, we understand there will be many Players eyeing off EcoSim driven purchases when these new countries go live so our best advice is to stay vigilant and keep alert by listening to the community and monitoring chatter across social media.



Additional Updates



In relation to Essence, we have also added the E-ther heatmap view option. Players can now see where E-ther has been detected by Mentars on the map, all across the world! This feature is the first step toward some possible bigger changes where the concentration of E-ther detection rates may have communal influence over various gameplay mechanisms. It also continues to demonstrate our ability to capture data and display relevant metrics on a global map, something that will be expanded upon over time, with other data sources inside Earth 2.



Other updates include:



Latest mapbox map version integration&nbsp;Updates to property Portfolio viewingUpdates to P2P Gifting featureContinuation of improvements to the Holobuilding editor (with more coming)&nbsp;

====================================================================================================
First Dev Vlog video in new Series goes Live



Earth 2 is proud to kick off the first installment of our new developer vlog series where we will be providing periodic updates and insights into parts of key technical developments that segments of our engineering team have been focusing on and prototyping.



One of the most exciting development areas for Earth 2 is our advanced terrain rendering engine, which is relevant for our longer-term Phase 3 implementation plans and is a major focus of our 3D open world developmental roadmap.&nbsp; This engine will not only support real-time, photorealistic terrain and environment rendering on a large-scale but also accurately reflect our real world’s topology, locations and importantly our digital land grid system representing Player ownership of tiles from all over the world.&nbsp;



Earth 2 intends to deliver the first version (v1) of our own internally developed 1:1 scale 3D Earth in 2022 which will mark an accomplishment achieved from focusing on and solving the bigger issues related to creating a world size geolocational metaverse, first.



This v1 will officially become part of our Phase 2 scope to facilitate interactive game play, with some team members referring to it internally as Phase 2.5, and this dev vlog, displaying technology we developed late last year, provides a glimpse of the beginning while showing just how versatile and realistic even Phase2, v1 will be.&nbsp;



In progression of our vision for The People’s Metaverse, Earth 2 is concurrently working on improvements to aspects of the Earth 2 experience for our community by launching this new dev vlog series on YouTube.



It should be noted that these vlogs will be confined to progress on developments which we are comfortable with becoming public and for confidentiality reasons may not accurately reflect what our team is actively working on at the point in time the vlog is published. 





https://youtu.be/EEuli1-1-kE



This series endeavours to bring the community updates via vlogs and while some of these topics may reflect work-in-progress and open research (non-finished products), we’d still like to be transparent in sharing our approach and, where feasible, explain our progress and how we’ve chosen to address and implement many of the broader rendering, persistence and technical challenges that will ultimately enable various aspects of Earth 2’s metaverse to become a reality.



Like, comment and subscribe to the Earth 2 YouTube Channel to keep up to date with all future dev vlogs. 



New Leaderboard Data and other Updates go Live



Leaderboards provide interesting data on Player activity occurring inside of Earth 2 and we intend to expand this data considerably over time.  The most recent data release includes information about High-Quality Jewels, Holobuildings, the Most Expensive Properties Sold/Purchased and last but not least, the amount of Essence collectively claimed over the past 24 hrs and the past 7 days (updates are still deploying and data will become available over the next few hours).



We have also added the ability to view data per country, per continent, per associated flag, per associated flag continent and in the case of High-Quality Jewels, per Player.



Occasionally, data we share may be relevant to future game play or strategies, as may be the case with the 24hr and 7 day Essence production Leaderboard. We are conscientious about Player privacy and have added an opt-in option for displaying a username on the High-Quality Jewels Leaderboard and it is our intention to make this option available on some future Leaderboard data releases as well.



To view a list of recent updates we have deployed such as easier identification of Mentars on properties, public display of Essence remaining on a property, removal of the re-captcha function and much more, please check out our Updates history page at :

Title: Dev Vlog #2 looks at Earth 2 Building Tech
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/03/24/dev-vlog-2-looks-at-earth-2-building-tech/

====================================================================================================
March 25, 2022, Sydney



Earth 2 is excited to share the second video of our new Dev Vlog series showcasing the first EcoSim building, the Water Processor, in its Phase 2 form.  



Initial showcases will focus on buildings being visually represented in their Phase 2 model format pertinent to the Earth 2 EcoSim, but we can confirm, with much excitement, that over time our showcases will proceed to reveal other buildings such as houses, shops, sky scrapers, transportation stations, educational facilities, marketplaces, social hubs, vehicles and more. 



Our technical team have been working on specialised, custom technology that will not only allow us to procedurally load and stream these buildings as 3D objects inside our massive 1:1 scale digital replication of the planet Earth, but importantly allow for this to be done at lightning speed and support significant Player customisation.&nbsp;



These specialised 3D object will using our internally developed custom shader system that will provide Earth 2 Players with an incredible amount of surface customisation on objects they own. Our solution not only accommodates for the colouration adjustment on numerous visual components but goes further by supporting the alteration of surface types such as metalic or dielectric material and even further by providing controls for surface shininess.



This solution will give our Players creative control over how each building is visually represented on their property and our custom developed technology will support tens of thousands of different buildings with each one having thousands of possible variations in appearance.



Earth 2 is building technology that will be applied not only to our customised 3D models but also to our open world terrain engine, demonstrating our heavy focus on developing a solution that will stream millions of 3D objects, resulting in an aesthetically consistent world that can uniquely support the streaming of this extensive variety of Player customised 3D objects.



We want our system to become the nucleus for connecting Players to an unimaginable number of experiences both inside and outside of Earth 2.

Title: Earth2Day &amp; Active Player Essence Rewards
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/04/23/earth2day/

====================================================================================================
April 23, 2022, Sydney



The Acknowledgement of Earth Day and the introduction of Earth 2 Day marked with Essence rewards for Active Players



We hope all is well and we’d like to wish everyone a Happy Earth Day, 2022.  



Earth Day&nbsp; was first proposed as a day where we, as its inhabitants, would honour the Earth and the concept of peace.&nbsp; This notion was developed into a calendar event and duly named “Earth Day” by Gaylord Nelson and Denis Hayes, the latter being directly responsible for expanding the event beyond its original idea which would lead to the largest single day protest in human history involving over 20 million people on its inauguration.



52 years on and this day continues to serve as an annual reminder of our obligation to protect our environment, restore damaged ecosystems, live a more sustainable life and much more.&nbsp; Remaining vigilant across these objectives returns a positive outlook not only for humanity, but for all living inhabitants of our planet, Earth.



Earth 2 has long term goals to provide assistance back to Earth 1 across numerous noteworthy causes including humanitarian, environmental, educational and more.  We often refer to this as our E24E1 initiative. 



Our commitment to building our own 1:1 scale digital replication of the planet Earth provides Earth 2 with the opportunity to propagate visually influential 3D environments to create awareness on various issues, including those related to the environment.  Over time we plan to leverage  on this opportunity to drive awareness for important relevant global causes.



As a reminder of this goal our team would like to reserve a day each year for Earth 2 and its community to review the effectiveness of support we are directing back to help Earth 1, how we are utilising our digital world to raise awareness for relevant issues and how we could improve all such initiatives moving forward. 



The day following Earth Day makes the most sense for this day as Earth 2 was made in the image of Earth.  Therefore we would like to reserve April 23rd for Earth2Day moving forward.  By #Earth2Day 2023 we aim to have steady #E24E1 initiatives in place and in turn have something noteworthy to celebrate on this new day.



To mark the beginning of Earth2Day we will be rewarding all active Earth 2 Players with x3 the Essence they successfully transformed over the 22nd and the 23rd of April.  The 22nd being more of a retroactive reward to those who are regularly transforming their Essence and the 23rd being for those who are keeping up to date with our announcements, such as this one.



For Players who transform 0-3 Essence over these two days, you will receive the balance to a total of 10 Essence as a bonus (i.e if you transform 3 Essence then your bonus will be 3&#215;3= 9 + 1 extra to make 10. If you transform 0 then your bonus will be 0x0=0 + 10 to make 10) Thereby rewarding all who acknowledge the commencement of Earth2Day.



Rewards will be added to Player accounts on or before the 3rd of May, 2022 and we expect the bonus to be somewhere between 500,000 to 700,000 Essence in total.



As a final memento of the first Earth2Day and Earth Day alike, we thought it fitting to share the beauty of our planet Earth in the form of a short video using our digital Earth, the WIP E2V1, spinning 4 looped rotations.









Thank you for your ongoing support and please stay tuned for further updates including the next dev vlogs covering the Lignator followed by the Research Lab and more.

Title: Earth 2 Announces Strategic Partnership with R/GA
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/05/07/earth2-rga-partnership/

====================================================================================================
May 7, 2022, Sydney Australia &#8211; Metaverse platform Earth 2, a futuristic concept for a geolocational 1:1 scale second Earth, is excited to officially announce a strategic partnership with the internationally recognised, award winning, innovation and design-driven global company R/GA. 



The R/GA Singapore partnership will integrate product strategy, experience design, product design, and web and mobile build into Earth 2. In addition, R/GA Singapore will work closely with Earth 2 in the coming months to refresh the Earth 2 brand via the website to help the wider public better understand the Earth 2 vision and provide a great user experience for the Earth 2 app.

Beginning with the launch of Essence, its official utility token in Q3 this year, Earth 2’s commitment to broadly decentralise key parts of its large centralised platform means that alignment with the right strategic partners is more important than ever.



“R/GA’s reputation and achievements speak for themselves and a firm like R/GA not only know how to design and build products but also how to launch them and create market awareness. We were so impressed with R/GA’s early work and professionalism that we entrusted Dot and her amazing team with reviewing and improving the design, development and launch of our upcoming Social Media platform later in 2022.  It is beyond exciting to have such a talented and experienced group focusing on core improvements across multiple facets of the Earth 2 Metaverse.” &#8211; Shane Isaac, Earth 2 CEOThe Earth 2 Social Media platform is one of the premier products Earth 2 has scheduled for public release in 2022 and R/GA has the experience, knowledge and technical know-how to successfully design, build and launch such an influential product. 



“Very excited to work with Shane and his team on an ambitious project like Earth2. We&#8217;re passionate about brand, and bringing it to life across multiple platforms is something we look forward to doing.”- Rollen Gomes, Technology Director, R/GA



This strategic partnership will refine the Earth 2 brand allowing it to connect the broader public while creating a truly new experience for Players allowing them to communicate, create and collaborate in the Earth 2 Metaverse and beyond.

Title: Resource Heatmap &amp; Fractions of Essence
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/05/20/gold-oil-heatmap/

====================================================================================================
May 20, 2022,



Dear Earth 2 Players,



We hope all is well.&nbsp; We’re excited to announce that the Gold and Oil Resource Heatmap will go live over the next 24 hours!&nbsp; While the first release of official resource locations on Earth 2 is a milestone to celebrate, there are some important things to consider so we would highly suggest reading and re-reading the information below very carefully.



The Resource Heatmap, in this case for Gold and Oil, will display binary data on each given resource, that is whether the resource exists or does not exist at a given location;It will not yet display the frequency or amount of that resource in that location.This binary data will be represented on Player owned properties, that is properties which have been purchased and owned already by a Player.One of the core purposes for releasing this information in a binary format is to provide indication to the Player’s who own property as to whether or not their property has Gold or Oil.While we are working with certain proximity radius datasets, just because a property has Gold or Oil confirmed on it does not mean adjacent tiles will return the same result after purchase.&nbsp; We advise Players not to rely on this assumption as it could often not be the case.New property purchases may take some time to reflect whether the new Player owned property contains any Gold or Oil, this could take up to 24 hours and in some cases longer.Presently, we have adapted the proximity radius datasets to be utilised in their most restricted form.&nbsp; That is to say, if your property is confirmed to have Gold or Oil in the areas displayed in this first Resource Heatmap then that resource will exist in the highest group of resource concentration / density for Gold and Oil.If your property is not yet confirming Gold or Oil, we do plan to release heatmaps for lesser levels of concentration which use broader proximity radius datasets in the future, but these will still have a general close proximity to the source, or a lesser source, and will be graded in concentration accordingly.&nbsp; So just because your property does not yet show Gold or Oil yet, does not mean it will not have Gold or Oil, we are simply focusing on the highest concentration areas first.If you believe your property should have received a high concentration of Gold or Oil but it has not been confirmed in this first version of the Resource Heatmap, you will still have your chance to challenge when the Resource Validation system goes live in approximately 5-6 weeks time.&nbsp; We suggest you begin collecting evidence such as official URLs, PDFs, papers, images and other material you may have to support your claim.The high density Gold and Oil Heatmaps will remain live over the next 2 weeks as we monitor, test and validate data.&nbsp; If all proceeds according to plan we aim to release additional Resource Heatmaps.



Gold and Oil lean toward the rarer types of resources that will initially be available for utilisation in Earth 2.&nbsp; Both, in their own way and depending on the purpose, will be required in varying quantities for constructing and supporting more advanced technologies, products and devices.&nbsp; In lower quantities they may also be required in other areas of the EcoSim.



The purpose of Essence, Resources, the EcoSim and more is for Earth 2 to provide an interesting economic foundation for Players to create and build on Earth 2 through activity and play.&nbsp; Value of things like Essence, Resources, Raw Materials and such should be considered as speculative at this stage.



We anticipate that eager and proactive Players will use this new feature to influence their&nbsp; Jewel crafting, trading, and slotting. In particular, Players will be able to begin formulating gameplay strategies,&nbsp; such as optimising how they will slot jewels, the specific combinations, accumulate certain types of Jewels through crafting or user-to-user trading, collaborate with other players as part of a Megacity, and incorporate holobuildings on their property/ies, all based on the Resources Heatmap.&nbsp;



We congratulate property owners who have detected Gold or Oil on their property in this initial Resource Heatmap release and we Look forward to releasing more resource datasets over coming weeks.



Essence Fractions are Coming Soon!&nbsp;



The tracking and transformation of E-ther into fractions of Essence is a significant update to how E-ther is claimed and transformed moving forward. This new feature will allow Players to monitor the detailed progression of each transformation of E-ther into Essence and will immediately be more useful and beneficial for smaller property owners, especially as Essence becomes more and more difficult to produce.



We expect Essence Fractions to go live by May 31, 2022 but have an important message we wanted to convey at least one week before this update is rolled out to the public.



Please read the following message very carefully :&nbsp;&nbsp;



We have noticed that many Players progressively ‘collect’ their E-ther, saving it up over time to use at once in a larger conversion.&nbsp; We realise there are, and will continue to be, many different types of strategies Players will test and utilise on Earth 2.&nbsp; Strategies that may or may not benefit the Player, but this is all part of what we want our Metaverse to become.



If you are a Player who saves your E-ther to convert into Essence, we would like to officially forewarn you that before the Essence fraction update goes live, we will need to automatically transform all E-ther balances into Essence for ALL PLAYERS.&nbsp; This should not alter the normal transformation you have been experiencing to date, however, we realise some Players may just wish to manually transform their saved up E-ther before we do it automatically.



If we plan for this automatic transformation to happen earlier we will release an announcement notifying the community to please keep an eye out for updates video our Discord, Facebook and Twitter social channels.  Otherwise, you can expect the automatic transformation to be executed the 24 hours before 8am UTC, May 31, 2022.



This update to introduce fractions of Essence will not see a reduction to the current Essence transformation rates.



For all the latest developments on Earth 2, be sure to follow our Discord, Facebook and Twitter and check our News and Updates page regularly.Thank you for ongoing involvement and support of the Earth 2 project and we look forward to releasing more updates soon.

Title: Essence Fractions, Vlog #6 &amp; more
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/05/29/vlog6/

====================================================================================================
Announcement Sunday the 29th of May 



Dear Earth 2 Players and Community,



We hope all is well.&nbsp; This announcement is made up of 3 separate parts so please ensure you read each part to keep yourself up to date with the latest Earth 2 news and instructions.



VLOG #6 &#8211; Residential &amp; Commercial Buildings + More EcoSim Details



Our recent VLOGs have been focused on EcoSim buildings and the work in progress development of E2V1, our 1:1 scale digital version of the planet Earth.  The focus on these upcoming features inevitably detracts from some of the other long term goals Earth 2 has and for this reason, we have decided to take a break and cover Residential and Commercial style buildings along with other various details for vlog number 6.



We urge you to check VLOG 6 out on YouTube at your earliest convenience&nbsp; :









Essence Fractions



Our plan is to deploy an update launching Essence Fractions on our website by the 31st of May, along with some key changes to the way E-ther is collected and transformed into Essence, and how that looks on the site.&nbsp;



This update will not yet make Essence more difficult to harvest, but it is an important step toward the upcoming contract system geared at allowing Land Owners to form agreements with EcoSim Players to manage individual properties.&nbsp; This ability to contract is a key requirement we would like to have in place before Essence becomes more difficult to harvest.



The progressive bar for Essence Fractions is also helpful for smaller property owners who will now be able to monitor and measure their E-ther transformations into Essence.



We would like to remind Players who have been collecting large amounts of E-ther before transforming that any stored E-ther on a Player account before we deploy Essence Fractions will be automatically transformed into Essence.&nbsp; Here are some key changes you can expect with the upcoming Essence Fraction deployment:



Claiming E-ther



The “Claim E-ther” function will no longer be found on the Player profile page. Instead, the Essence icon will glow when E-ther which has evaporated from your property has been detected and is ready to claim. By clicking on the Essence icon, Players can claim and transform their E-ther into Essence.



Tracking Essence



There is a new feature which has been added to keep track of your E-ther transformation into Essence called the Progress Bar. The progress bar will help Players keep track of their Essence Fractions by showing the percentage of a full unit of Essence they have so far collected.&nbsp;



When Essence Fractions go live, there will be some changes to how often E-ther spawns and the way it converts to Essence. We therefore remind all Players that 24 hours before the launch of Essence Fractions, all collected E-ther awaiting transformation will automatically be transformed by Earth 2. We understand that some Players would like to do this transformation themselves so we are providing this important reminder that should you wish to do this, please transform any stored E-ther by the 30th of May.



Egg Winners&nbsp; for #10 and #11 + Challenge Period for Egg #14



Final winners for Eggs #10 and #11 are now live on our website.&nbsp; We have also released preliminary winners for Egg #14 which is now open to receive challenges via email.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Previously we would assign an Egg number to an Egg when it was found, however, we realised this did not indicate whether some eggs remained unfound to the Players.&nbsp; Eggs #12 and #13 have still not been found.



Remember that ALL times used in the Egg Winners list are displayed in GMT.&nbsp; We have noticed that some Players still do not realise this and compare the GMT winner times with their own local timezone.

Thank you for reading this announcement, we hope you enjoy our latest Vlog and continue to follow us for more scheduled updates coming over the next weeks and months!&nbsp;

Title: Earth 2 passes100 Million tile sales, Iron Ore Heatmap Release &amp; more
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/06/09/e2-passes-100m-tiles/

====================================================================================================
June 9, 2022 – Sydney, Australia &#8211; On the 2nd of June, 2022, Earth 2 officially sold its 100,000,000th tile!!  This works out the be an average of over 1,000,000 tiles per week!  These are some very powerful figures as the Essence token launch edges closer in Q3, 2022.



“This is a monumental achievement for Earth 2! Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that we would be sitting in this position only a year and a half after launching.&nbsp; I honestly believed that it would have taken 18 months before seeing any traction, let alone acquire the success that we have.  I am truly humbled by the incredible amount of support our project has received”, said Shane Isaac, CEO and Founder of Earth 2. “Whether you agree or disagree with Earth 2’s goals and ambitions, you cannot argue with Earth 2’s&nbsp; success”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



“Our success to date provides us with a unique opportunity to build something that is not influenced by corporate money”, Shane went on to say.&nbsp; “We enjoy a very strong community who share our vision and want to be part of the journey each step of the way.&nbsp; Although our journey will be long, our goal is to make it as interesting and as engaging&nbsp; as possible for our community, as we gradually build toward bigger things.&nbsp; We’re particularly excited about releases we have planned over the next 12 months which will really start to shape Earth 2 and will hopefully start to see the patience and hard work that takes place in the background become more apparent.”



Earth 2 had previously anticipated reaching 100,000,000 tile sales in late July 2022, and was planning a special release for early August to celebrate. This was to coincide with a marketing awareness campaign planned in conjunction with the much-anticipated launch of Earth 2’s Essence token.&nbsp; However, the 100 millionth tile sale occurred much earlier than expected and due to the constant high workload on Earth 2 team members, time to create and plan a new celebration befitting the occasion was not possible.



This special moment will not, however, be put aside completely. In recognition of this great milestone, there will be a reward for the lucky Player who purchased the 100,000,000th tile, and the Player’s Username, along with the prize, will be confirmed in our next announcement. In the meantime, Shane will be running a few small competitions from his personal Twitter account over the next couple of weeks. Details of the competitions will be explained via his twitter account over the course of the next week but all participants must at least have a free Earth 2 account to receive any prizes.



IRON ORE HEATMAP



The Iron Ore heatmap will be released over the next 48 hours as part of Earth 2’s progression toward the full release of resource locations and the EcoSim.&nbsp; Players are reminded that if a property does not appear to have a resource in the initial release, this does not mean the property will not show up on progressive releases of the heatmap showing less concentrated areas. All Players are also reminded that the Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) system will enable Players and the community to further validate properties that should contain a particular resource, a feature that is anticipated to go live later this month.



Players will be urged to make resource validation submissions as soon as possible once E2PRV is deployed to avoid missing Essence bonuses for automatic validations on other properties that may be in close proximity to the first submissions the Earth 2 team approves.&nbsp; For this reason, we are considering a 2-3 week grace period before submission approvals begin.



COUNTRY COUNTDOWNS AND MENTARS &nbsp;



Earth 2 will trial a short countdown on the next country release for the purpose of testing some server updates but also to allow Players the chance to plan ahead and potentially purchase new tiles at the new country rate starting at E$0.10 per tile.&nbsp; This countdown will be broadcasted on the Earth 2 landing page.&nbsp; Results will be reviewed by the team, including possible exploitations, after which time a decision will be made whether countdowns will continue.



A change to how Mentars are constructed is coming.&nbsp; The new method will mean Players will no longer need to login 7 times over 14 days to complete tasks for building their Mentar but will also mean that all future properties will no longer automatically receive pre-constructed Mentars on them.



In the near future, Players will need to construct Mentars individually on each property and will not be able to purchase Mentars in E$ as Earth 2 will be removing the in-game purchase option.&nbsp;



Players who do not yet have Mentars on their property are urged to complete the current 7 day login challenge to receive Mentars on all existing properties for free before this new update comes into place over coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Earth 2 will also be running a promotion where new land purchased in new country openings will receive a Mentar, updated periodically, so long as the first step to constructing the Mentar has been taken.&nbsp; This promotion will be beneficial for new Players allowing them to start collecting and transforming E-ther faster.  More details about this promotion be released in a future announcement.  



EGG HUNT UPDATE



The final winners list for Egg 14 was finalised today and the initial winners lists for Eggs 15 and 16 &nbsp; are now open for challenges over the next&nbsp; 5 days. Players are reminded that the 5 day challenge period is adhered to strictly and time between the end of the challenge period and the posting of the final winners list is used to process the challenges made within the challenge period only.&nbsp;



Players should also note that sharing the location of a hidden Egg on any social channel, including Discord constitutes a violation of the Egg Hunt rules, especially when the list of winners has not been announced. Congratulations to the winner of Egg 14 and good luck to all participants for Egg 15 and 16.&nbsp;

*   a note about the concept artwork.  The Earth 2 artist team have created a number of varying concept art pieces and mood drawings to help with future visualisation, planning and design of environments, 3D models and more.  We share one such image here to celebrate the 100,000,000 tile sales on the Earth 2 platform.

Title: Ongoing Weekly Countdowns for Mentar Giveaways And New Country Releases!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/07/11/countdowns-mentars/

====================================================================================================
July 11th &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; After recently achieving an incredible milestone of 100 million tiles sold, Earth 2 will trial public countdowns, starting with not one, but two countdowns, every week over the next couple of months.&nbsp;



The first countdown will trigger the opening of a new country, while the second countdown will gift instant Mentars in the relevant country to any Players who have at least started the Mentar&#8217;s Quest on their Earth 2 Player account.&nbsp;



Since the Dubai countdown, Earth 2 has randomly released new countries without any public notice and many Players understandably found it difficult to schedule their involvement.&nbsp; Countdowns will remove that level of uncertainty and provide new Players with an opportunity to secure land at the highly desirable entry price of E$0.10.



The countdowns will appear shortly on the Earth 2 landing page.&nbsp; We would also remind Players that a total limit of 750 tiles a day will still apply per Player over the first 48 hours post new country releases.



Weekly Mentar Giveaway



Every week, we will be randomly selecting a special country for the Mentar giveaway. All you have to do is start the Mentar building process on your property in that country before the countdown ends and you will be gifted an instant Mentar for each Mentar-less property you own inside the selected country. Make sure to stay tuned for announcements on our socials to see if your property is in one of the lucky countries of the week!



New Lands, New Opportunities&nbsp;



Countdowns for new country releases will be posted every week until there are no more new countries remaining. Tiles in the new country will be up for grabs starting at E$0.10 per tile.



As a bonus for new Players, any Player who purchases land within the first 6 days of a new country release, and at least starts their Mentar quest, will receive free Mentars daily on those new properties within the relevant country release, up until the 7th day from release.&nbsp;&nbsp;



This means new Players will be able to start claiming E-ther and transforming it to Essence for free, and much faster than usual. Essence will become a key digital utility currency inside of Earth 2 and will be launching as an official utility token on external trading exchanges later this year.&nbsp;



This is a brilliant opportunity for new Players who have been following Earth 2- you don’t have to be a “whale” to get involved when tile prices start at just E$0.10!&nbsp; Keep an eye out for upcoming country release announcements, so you can start detecting E-ther and transform it into Essence before our upcoming official token launch!



Player Resource Validation on the Doorstep



E2PRV (Earth 2 Player Resource Validation) is a system where Players can submit Claims for improved Resource distribution, and back other Claims in the community by staking Essence for a bonus reward when a Claim is validated. Put simply &#8211; if your Property should be producing a type or more of a particular Resource, submit a Claim! If you want to help another Player improve Resource distribution on their land, then put down some of your own Essence to improve their chances, and get rewarded for it too! Help your neighbors and they might just help you right back. If you are part of a Megacity, get everyone involved and share in the rewards!

A Quick Refresher on Mentars



What is a Mentar?



New to the world of Earth 2? We’ve got you covered. The Mentar is an essential building responsible for detecting E-ther as it evaporates from your land, and transforming it into Essence.&nbsp;



Mentars can also be slotted with different jewels to enhance Resource or E-ther production on your Property.&nbsp;



What is the Mentar’s Quest ? (How to build a Mentar)



The Mentar’s Quest is a Player’s quest to populate their property/ies with Mentars for the purpose of detecting E-ther and transforming it into Essence. Currently, Players are required to login frequently, over a period of 14 days, in order to complete the Mentar building process.

Title: Earth 2 Player Resource Validation
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/07/15/e2prv/

====================================================================================================
July 15, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to announce the release of our very own Player Resource Validation system. Less than 12 hours after quietly releasing this new feature yesterday, and prior to this official announcement, our systems experienced over 25,000 unique stakes made up of over 600,000 Essence!



Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV)



Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) is now live on Earth 2! What is E2PRV? It is a system that was created to empower Players with the ability to claim a Resource that our initial Resource deployment system may have missed. Our Resource deployment system is extensive and constantly evolving and we felt it was crucial for us to provide the Players with the opportunity to be part of that evolving system and claim Resources that they feel their property is entitled to.&nbsp;



This validation system is also being trialled for other purposes, which will come to light in the not too distant future once refinements, tweaks and fixes are finalised. One of the key components of the Resource Validation system is the rewards system for successful validations.&nbsp;



How Do I Claim?



The Claims process is simple and starts from within your Profile dropdown menu on the upper right side of the screen. Select ‘Resource Claims’ to go to the Claims Manager. From there, you can select ‘Your Claims’ and then select ‘Create A Claim +’ at the bottom left of the screen. Once there, you can select the Resource you wish to claim, the property you believe the Resource is on and provide all relevant evidence. A more detailed guide for the whole process can be found at https://earth2.io/how-to?id=claims-manager.



Do note that there will be a potentially refundable assurance fee for submitting a claim, this will be referred to as the Resource Claim Assurance Fee which we can confirm will start at E$4.95. If your claim is successful, you will get your Resource Claim Assurance Fee back in full. The purpose of the Resource Claim Assurance fee is to disincentivise Players from simply claiming the Resources they want rather than the ones they are entitled to and taking up valuable Claim Investigation resources which would inevitably slow down the evaluation of legitimate Claims.&nbsp;



The Resource Claim Assurance Fee for each successful Claim will be returned to your E$ balance within 24 hours of the Claim being approved together with the allocation of the approved Resource, as well as any Essence rewards the claimant is entitled to.&nbsp; It is worth noting that Resources will be backdated to the date that any existing Holobuildings were placed on your property.&nbsp; Any such Holobuildings should remain in an active state to claim this backdated reward.



How Long Does a Claim Take?



The length of the review period may vary case by case as the process is dependent on the review of Player gathered data. In some circumstances, the evaluation process may be time consuming so, depending on demand, it is possible for a Claim investigation&nbsp; to take weeks before any official validation is granted.



Please also note that approvals will not take place for at least 3 weeks from the initial release of Resource Validations, to allow all Players the opportunity to get their initial Claims submitted in good time. There will be a subsequent announcement made just before we start evaluating Claims, so be sure to keep an eye out for that.



Distribution Area of Resources After Validation



Additionally, we will use a variety of factors to determine the radius of the Resource distribution area. In some cases it may depend on the number of successful Claims within close proximity, but Players should not rely on this data alone as there always has to be a boundary for every Resource pocket. Claims with maximum possible Essence staked will also receive more attention from the validation team. The decision to approve or reject a claim ultimately rests with Earth 2 and we may occasionally approve claims for balancing reasons. We expect Players to be conducting thorough due diligence before creating or backing a Claim, given the potential to lose the Resource Claim Assurance fee, and any staked Essence, should the Claim be unsuccessful. We must stress that, within reason, we do not anticipate a large number of unsuccessful Claims.&nbsp; Note that a Player can submit as many Claims as they have properties in their profile.



Player Resource Validation Essence Bonus



E2PRV provides a unique opportunity for Players to collaborate with other existing and new Players alike, and share in this unique opportunity to receive an Essence boost. This boost is the official Player Resource Validation Essence Bonus! Every time a Player creates a Claim, the Claim creators and other Players will have the option to stake Essence if they believe the Claim is accurate and is entitled to the relevant Resource. The size of the property will determine the total amount of Essence Players can collectively stake, which is up to a maximum of 3 Essence per tile per property being validated. The maximum one Player can stake on each Claim is 30 Essence, however, that maximum reduces for Claims on smaller properties to offer more Players the opportunity to validate and avoid Players being able to fully validate a claim alone.



Upon successful validation of a Claim, the E2PRV Essence bonus will consist of Earth 2 returning double the staked Essence to the backing Player! For example, if a Player stakes 30 Essence against their Claim, they will receive their 30 Essence back plus an additional 30 Essence. This 100% Essence Bonus will be the initial reward rate for early supporters of the E2PRV initiative and may be reduced over time. Players can rest assured that any reduction in the Essence bonus rate will be announced and will not affect any Claims submitted before the announcement, even if those Claims are validated after the new reward rate comes into effect.&nbsp;



We urge any Players wishing to boost their Essence to take advantage of this E2PVR initiative and maybe help newer Players out by discussing and collaborating in the dedicated #resource-validation-collab channel (https://discord.gg/earth2) in our official Discord server.



It is our hope that our existing, more experienced players will collaborate with the less experienced newcomers to help them with their Claims and encourage support within the Earth 2 community.



As with any new feature, we anticipate tweaks and adaptations to take place, so please keep your eyes out on our social channels or news page for any updates.



Thank you and stay tuned for further detailed instructions to come!

Title: Player Resource Validation approvals are about to begin!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/08/12/e2prv-approvals/

====================================================================================================
August 12, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; It has been just over 3 weeks since we launched the Earth 2 Player Resource Validation system (“E2PRV”) and we have already received over 9,000 submitted claims with a combined staked Essence total over 7.6 million so far!&nbsp; That’s over 250,000 times players have staked to support claims which averages out to 8 stakes per minute since the launch of this feature!



The amount of research and thought put into claims has been outstanding and it’s great to see the Earth 2 player community taking advantage of this unique opportunity to double their Essence. But be warned, the 100% reward* for staking successful claims will be reduced over the coming weeks.&nbsp; 



*All existing claims up until that date is announced will retain the possibility of a 100% staking reward.&nbsp;



FINAL APPROVALS ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN!!



To everyone who has made a Player Resource Validation claim, good news &#8211; the CAT (Claims Approval Team) is ready to start final approvals for the first claims with the first batch of approvals being released as soon as today!&nbsp;



We are not committing to any set schedule for releasing final batch approvals for claims, in some cases it may be daily or weekly, but you can expect some form of consistency around those time frames to start from next week.



The final approval involves steps that are taken following internally pre-approved claims.&nbsp; These steps include utilising a software solution we built that allows us to deploy predetermined or free hand shapes onto an internal global map essentially casting a net to approve the relevant resource in that area.&nbsp; Our system then cross references our database of over 100,000,000 tiles, comparing coordinates for the newly designated resource zone and assigning any properties within that zone the approved resource.&nbsp; Our system is also automated to check any existing claims that fall within this net to instantly grant approval to that claim if the resource claim matches the resource approval for the net area.&nbsp;



This may sound simple, but building it was quite complicated, especially for it to work effectively with mass data on a scale as large as the planet&#8217;s surface, so we appreciate your patience while we work with this relatively new system and process the claims.



“We’re very excited about the future of this system. It’s being used to facilitate  manual pinpoint deployment of resource locations now, but in the future will be used for deployment of other interesting game mechanics, even things like loot areas, NPC spawning points, monsters, permit areas, safe zones, and that’s just a few to get the mind flowing”, said Shane Isaac, CEO and Founder of Earth 2. “When we think about the size of the planet’s surface and the fact we can set tiny radiuses of even a few meters in any shape imaginable, this system really does allow us to literally drop miniscule pinpoints inside a massive environment.&nbsp; I’m really excited about the different ways will utilise this system in the future.”



SMALL PLAYERS DON’T MISS OUT!



We understand that there is fierce competition to stake on claims and many strong claims only appear for a few seconds.&nbsp; We suggest collaborating with other players to increase your chances of getting in.



For all you players new to the system, why not jump into our discord and team up with some of our veteran E2 pioneers who can help get your first PRV claims and stakes completed and start increasing your Essence balance?&nbsp; This system was built keeping smaller players in mind and we have seen some players with as little as 3 Essence already quadruple their balance during the test approval phase alone. Even if you only own a few Essence, you can still participate!



REMEMBER &#8211; once you stake your Essence and start a claim, if the claim is unsuccessful you will lose your Essence, so make sure you&#8217;re confident in making a PRV before starting the process.&nbsp;



GUIDELINES ON HOW TO SUBMIT A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM



We&#8217;ve had a few cases of a minority of players not providing enough evidence to go along with their claims. Below is a handy table showing the kind of evidence we like to see from you, that ultimately helps us to approve the resources you’re claiming on your tiles faster.&nbsp;



Types of evidence:



✅ Accepted&nbsp;❌ Not AcceptedImage✓ Detailed screenshot of the mine site your property is situated on (S)✓ Comparative Images of your property and a mine site showing corresponding boundaries ⨯ Screenshot of Earth 2 Biome⨯ maps with no markers or indicators of locationDocument✓ Official government, mining company, or similar records✓ documents that show geographical proof of a mine, deposit, etc. in area⨯ Outdated and/or irrelevant&nbsp; documentsLink✓ mindat.com✓ wikipedia.com (S)⨯ https://www.minecraft.net⨯ Broken links(These are suggestive guidelines only to help increase your chances of getting approved)



(S) = Supplementary &#8211; evidence that can support a claim but not used solely to make one



REPORTING A CLAIM



Players who abuse the report function by either maliciously targeting or trolling other players, will be sent an official warning. If they continue to negligently report claims, they will risk their account being frozen.&nbsp; Players who have repeatedly offended to date have already been identified and should consider this message their first warning.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We also understand that some of our players may have been well-intentioned in their reporting of claims in an effort to clear up the system of invalid claims. However, this actually further slows down the process. The reporting function is strictly to be used for claims which contain spam, offensive and/or malicious content only.&nbsp;



Reporting claims without a valid reason ruins the experience for other players and hides relevant information for a player to decide whether they should back a claim. This is why we have taken a strong stance on this.



REPORTS OF BOT USE ON STAKING FOR CLAIMS



We are aware of reports from the community that a number of Players have spent time developing bots for staking Essence on Player Resource Validation Claims. We will be investigating these claims and identifying accounts who have potentially been using bots to stake their Essence quickly.  We suggest that any Players using bots to stake Essence cease to use them immediately.



Any accounts found using bots to stake Essence after Saturday the 13th of August at 6pm (UTC), will run the risk of losing their staked Essence and possibly having their account frozen.  We will also be looking at accounts who may have excessively abused the use of bots to stake Essence to date.



If you are using a bot to stake Essence and you don&#8217;t want to face penalties, stop using it immediately.



Please play fair.



GOOD LUCK!



As always we appreciate your feedback and patience as we move through these claims, if you have any comments or questions you can either hit us up on Twitter directly, respond to this announcement on our various socials or jump into the discord where members of the team and other community can help you out.



Sincerely, Earth 2

Title: U2U HoloBuilding Trading: Everything you need to know about buying and selling creations on the Bazaar.
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/08/31/u2u-hb-trading/

====================================================================================================
August 31, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; User-to-User (U2U) Trading of HoloBlueprints was quietly introduced to our stage2 test server a couple of weeks ago and many players jumped at the opportunity to begin exploring the new feature ahead of its official release today.&nbsp; Players testing the site also provided significant feedback, including reports of bugs, many of which we took on board and fixed so we thank those Players who spent their time on testing via stage2.



We are now extremely excited to officially share with you the first iteration of U2U Trading based purely on User-Generated Content (UGC) inside Earth 2, a concept that aligns with our vision for a people’s metaverse. We feel the people who inhabit Earth 2 should be empowered to customise their virtual experiences and a major part of this is providing the right tools for Players to make digital creations that persist inside our digital world but may also be viewable and interactable from the physical one.



While this initial version of U2U Trading only facilitates the sale of HoloBlueprints, it precedes future updates which will expand this feature to allow many different forms of UGC and other digital assets to be traded on Earth 2.&nbsp;



For now, we are very happy to fulfill the promise we made to our community, that there would be a place on Earth 2 for creators to sell their digital creations. Some of our most involved player creators have been waiting for such a feature and we can’t wait to see their amazing pieces of work show up for sale!



HOLOBUILDING ORIGIN



Before we look ahead to what HoloBlueprint trading means for the future of UGC on Earth 2, let’s revisit the original purpose of HoloBuildings, when they were first introduced.&nbsp;



HBs were originally researched and developed to allow Players the ability to plot out future virtual constructions, weighing up size, look, aesthetic feel and more, based on the HBs they are able to create blueprints for.



From there, HoloBuildings were given more purpose with the aim to reward Player creativity.&nbsp; So instead of Earth 2 designing a basic storage building and selling that building directly to Players, we decided to do something quite unique and add in-game utility to Player created HoloBuildings.&nbsp; Players who have created or purchased a HoloBuilding and place it on their property will have the ability to retroactively receive Resource storage space.&nbsp; The particulars will be detailed in a later update specifically addressing the relevant EcoSim components and how that storage space will be activated.&nbsp;



Not only do HoloBuildings have utility in the Earth 2 EcoSim, they have been a successful medium for visually representing many forms of&nbsp; expression and creativity within our community and within our world. Whether you see value in a HoloBuilding for the storage capabilities, or the pure aesthetics, U2U trading of HoloBlueprints will be beneficial to Players in multiple ways. Moving forward our team plans to build on the current utility and incorporate more ways for HoloBuildings to be visually represented on the Earth 2 platform.



USER 2 USER TRADING OF UGC



In general, the trading of UGC will grow to become a core component of the Earth 2 Platform.&nbsp; It is something we are extremely eager to build on and expand. In the future, as the EcoSim slowly comes online and different types of UGC are made possible on Earth 2,&nbsp; U2U Trading will in turn be expanded to facilitate trading of that content and potentially even content from Web3 at a later date.&nbsp;



Players should be aware of the risks involved with trading digital assets, in this case UGC, and we suggest extra caution is taken while purchasing anything you believe may be plagiarised or infringe on another party&#8217;s trademark or copyright.&nbsp; It is entirely possible that plagiarised, copied or trademarked items will be taken down, so as a purchaser, we suggest limiting your exposure to such situations if you identify a potential risk.&nbsp; We also suggest you report any HoloBuildings you suspect may be falling into the above category, to assist our team in keeping the HoloBuilding trading platform clean.



We ask everyone to respect the time and effort Content Creators take to create their end product and what that product means to them.  Any accounts caught downloading other Player’s designs and then relisting them will be subject to investigation, so we highly suggest this type of behaviour be avoided to ensure your account avoids ramifications for such actions. 



In addition to this, digital plagiarism is an issue that affects the world on many different levels, especially with 3D assets. As with the rest of the world, Earth 2 is not immune to people using methods of extracting digital information from our website, but we will be active in reporting people who plagiarise Earth 2 creators’ models and then use them outside of the platform without the appropriate consent from the content Creator.  We will also report people who leak ways to hack or abuse our website, especially those who publicly spread such information.



Please make sure to read the difference between the license types we are allowing to be traded, based on the trading and usage permissions they have. This is only the first iteration of UGC U2U trading and we welcome feedback from our community as we expect more improvements to be made to the feature.&nbsp; It should be noted that we will be making improvements to the current system which will include the ability for Players to be able to resell HoloBuildings they purchase, this is paramount to Earth 2’s ideology and supports a healthy secondary market.&nbsp;



GET STARTED



Here is a quick overview of the HoloBlueprint trading to get you started. If you are interested in more details on how to navigate the new HoloBlueprints Bazaar, please check out the How-To at earth2.io/how-to.



You can list your HoloBlueprint as a HoloBuilding or Blueprint license.&nbsp;HoloBuildings and Blueprints can be bought and sold as many times as desired. However, Blueprint licenses are the original plans for a HoloBuilding and are bought and sold as the original.&nbsp;You can add up to 5 relevant tags to target your listing.A sale fee of 5% will be added on top of the listed price.You can click the heart icon on each HoloBlueprint listing to save them to your “Liked” items section.&nbsp;



HOLOBUILDING VS. BLUEPRINT LICENSE



There are 2 different types of HoloBlueprint licenses that you can trade in the bazaar that determine how it can be used and traded. See below for the key differences between the two license types:



HoloBuilding LicenseBlueprint LIcenseThe HoloBuilding&nbsp; license&nbsp; allows you&nbsp; to place or use the HoloBuilding as many times as the number of HoloBuilding licenses you own.The license&nbsp; can be sold on the Bazaar as many times as the creator/seller desires.HoloBuilding licenses cannot be turned into a Blueprint license in the editor.&nbsp;Purchased HoloBuildings can be resold only as HoloBuildings&nbsp;To purchase multiple HoloBuildings, you will need to make multiple purchases. A HoloBuilding model is currently not able to be resold on the Bazaar once purchased.&nbsp;This license type allows you to place or use the HoloBuildings from this Blueprint as many times as you like, on as many properties as you want.A Blueprint license can only be sold once and, when the sale is finalized, &nbsp; the&nbsp; ownership of the HoloBlueprint&nbsp; is transferred to the purchaser.Once purchased, a Blueprint can be customized using the HoloBuilding Editor. The original Blueprint will not be affected and any changes will be saved as a new Blueprint design.The owner may resell the Blueprint on the Bazaar, as well as any HoloBuildings created from that Blueprint



PLANNED UPDATES TO HOLOBLUEPRINT TRADING



Here are some important planned updates to be aware of know when you go to buy or sell your first HoloBlueprint.&nbsp;



Please read the license type and the usage properties before buying or selling a HoloBuilding or Blueprint license, as it affects the price, and what you are able to do with them.&nbsp;There are some restrictions on which HoloBuildings can be listed on the Bazaar based on some minimum requirements. If you are wanting to list immediately, your HoloBlueprint must be at least 4m high and contain at least 50 vertices.&nbsp;These restrictions will be lifted in the next update to the HoloBlueprints Bazaar. As more simple HoloBlueprints are able to be listed in the Bazaar, the reporting function will be expanded to include spam listings, in addition to offensive content.&nbsp;



Any changes detailed above will be implemented in a future update of the HoloBuilding trading platform. Please be mindful of this when using the U2U Trading system and the limitations that might currently be in place for you as a buyer or seller, until the next update.&nbsp;



While we understand this can be disappointing to some, we wanted to push this feature out for all those who have been eagerly waiting. Given U2U Trading is functioning as intended, we did not see an issue with releasing the feature before the next updates were implemented, which will be very soon anyway.&nbsp;



IMPORTANT UPDATE ON E2PRV CLAIMS



To finish off the announcement, we would like to notify all players that Limestone will be disabled as a claimable resource. We do not have a set date on when it will become available to claim again.



Many Earth 2 Players would also have noticed that their approved E2PRV claims are displaying a frequency value of “UF” (Undetermined Frequency). Please note that this will be changed in the future to reflect a more accurate&nbsp; frequency, but Players should be aware that the final&nbsp; frequency will, at best, be lower than “HF”.&nbsp;



The E2PRV system has been extremely successful with many Players taking full advantage of the initial Essence Bonus rate of 100% Essence reward for early stakers. This bonus rate was initially implemented to reward the early participaters of the E2PRV system, many of which have taken a great advantage of, and now, at this point in time we will be reducing the&nbsp; rate to 50%. As mentioned in our previous announcements, the Essence bonus rate will continue to be monitored and may be adjusted in the future .&nbsp;



We would also like to reassure our players that all claims submitted before the U2U Holobuilding Trading update will still be honored with the previous 100% Essence bonus rate.&nbsp; Only new claims will be subjected to the 50% reward rate.&nbsp; We would also note that this rate may be adjusted in the future with new updates.



There are more plans for U2U trading and the E2PRV system, so make sure to keep updated by following us on all our socials!

Title: <strong>U2U HB Trading v1.1 plus other Updates!</strong>
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/09/16/hb-trading-update/

====================================================================================================
September 17, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; As promised, since launching User-to-User HB Trading on our platform just over two weeks ago, our team has held an internal review of the feature while taking community feedback on board.&nbsp; For information on this, the HB Trading Withdrawal Protocol, Downloadable 3D Models, Accusations of a Security breach and Other News, including final updates on Egg Hunts, please read on below.



We have begun working hard on major updates to the U2U HB Trading System with some already in the pipeline as a direct result of our internal review and community feedback. To those of you in our community who have provided feedback on this feature, we thank you.&nbsp;



We are particularly grateful for your support as we continue to improve our platform.&nbsp;



HOLOBLUEPRINT TRADING v1.1 IS IN THE PIPELINE&nbsp;



U2U HB Trading is the first iteration of our future User-Generated Content (UGC) Trading system being built on the Earth 2 platform. We’d like to share the core scheduled updates for version v1.1 of this feature which include significant improvements to the U2U trading mechanics, the usability of HBs in general, the rewards for HB Content Creators and improved copyright protection for all HB creations listed on the Bazaar marketplace inside Earth 2.&nbsp;



SCHEDULED UPDATES



Our design team has finished reviewing and updating the DDD (Detailed Design Doc) and our UI/UX team have subsequently finished the necessary visual updates to the relevant pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;






One of our smaller development teams have now started implementing the FE and BE changes for Limited Edition HoloBuildings and will then progress onto other scheduled updates in the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We expect to have this full list released within the next four weeks over 1 or 2 deployments.



Below is a very brief description of each scheduled update.



Limited Edition HoloBuildings: This update will provide Creators with the ability to set a restricted number for Limited Editions of their HoloBuilding in the Bazaar marketplace.&nbsp; The number will determine how many copies of that HoloBuilding can be sold from the Creator to other Players on the platform.



IMPORTANT NOTE:  The initial Limited Edition system will only be available to newly published HoloBuilding Creations that have not been sold before. When time permits, we may look at ways we can allow previously listed or sold HBs to be listed as Limited Edition, but for now, if you plan to release something as a Limited Edition, please ensure you wait for the Limited Edition Holobuildings update before submitting your creation for the first time.



The Ability to Resell Holobuildings: This update will allow Players to who purchase a Holobuilding, the ability to resell it again on the Bazaar effectively introducing a secondary market for HoloBuildings.



Royalties for Earth 2 HB Content Creators: This update will see the introduction of Royalties to Holobuildings and Blueprints. It will ensure that the original creator of a design is rewarded for their hard work and creativity every time that design is on-sold. We are proposing to set this figure at 3% for individual resales.&nbsp;&nbsp;



For resales that include multiple copies of different HoloBuildings from different creators, this figure will jump 3% for each new HoloBuilding used from different Creators, being capped at 12% at 4 creations.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Any new design that includes over 4 pre-existing HoloBuilding creations in it will see the 12% split between all original HB Content Creators whose designs were used.



Bazaar Listing URL: Players will be provided the option to share their Blueprint or Holobuilding via direct URL.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Holobuilding Duplication Detection: Earth 2 is working on a system that is designed to protect original HB content created and listed by Players in our community.&nbsp; This system will analyse and in some cases automatically block the listing of creations that are significantly similar to creations already listed on Bazaar by other creators.&nbsp;



It will also flag potential copycat listings for our team to review.



Personal Portfolio: The Player Profile page will be expanded to display a gallery of all HoloBuildings that Player has created and has listed.



We can’t wait to get some of these updates live and we’re committed to making future improvements to this marketplace system as we slowly move toward allowing other digital assets and User Generated Content to sell and trade between Players!



In the near future we will also look at improving the placement process of HoloBuildings making it more intuitive and easier for Players to place them on their properties.



HB TRADING WITHDRAWAL PROTOCOL



One of Earth 2’s core concepts for its metaverse platform is to support the ability for Players to sell or resell digital assets they own, build or create. It is our goal to develop a safe system for all Earth 2 Players to achieve this, something which is embodied in our initial HoloBuilding creation and trading system.&nbsp;&nbsp;



While we strongly believe that Players should have the power and freedom to generate earnings through Earth 2, we also have a duty of protection to HB Content Creators and Players who purchase those creations.&nbsp;



Therefore, we have implemented a new internal 14-day waiting period for withdrawals for those who have SOLD HoloBuildings or HoloBlueprints on the Bazaar. This delay gives HB Content Creators the opportunity to become aware of, and report, HB listings which they feel infringe on their rights as the original owner and creator of a HoloBlueprint or HoloBuilding.&nbsp;



We understand that those who have become accustomed to virtually instantaneous payouts on our platform may be inconvenienced by this procedure. However, it is first and foremost our highest priority to fulfill our duty to protect Earth 2 participants to introduce systems and protocols that hinder Players for selling content they do not own the rights to and cashing out quickly.



Our team will be monitoring and restricting HB Content Creators who abuse the system and negatively impact the experience of others by blocking them from being able to sell on the Bazaar and depending on the extent of the wrongdoing, potentially more. Players who set a good track record of participating in the HB trading may experience increasingly faster listing approvals and payouts.&nbsp;



A delay of payment is routine practice across many established platforms and we ask your understanding of this measure, especially during these initial stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may fine tune this procedure depending on the trends of Player behaviour on the Earth 2 platform.



USER GENERATED 3D MODELS and ACCUSATIONS OF SECURITY RISKS ON EARTH 2



Protecting our Players on any level is very important to us and when a potential risk to Players arises, whether it be a public accusation or a privately reported risk, our security team and developers will always conduct an investigation to eliminate the possibility.&nbsp;



Earth 2 hires one permanent security specialist and relies on Quality Assurance to pick up and mitigate against potential security weaknesses being pushed to production.&nbsp; As with any software company, the potential for security issues is always possible and fixing such issues is an ongoing commitment.



Below are some responses to the recent public accusations made toward the ability for 3D HoloBuilding models being downloadable from our website and an apparent version of our Front End code base + API keys being acquired.



3D Models



GLB files are files that are downloaded whenever a 3D model is shown in a browser, including when a HoloBuilding is shown on our map, or previews in the bazaar. This is normal browser behaviour and if it were not possible to some how download the 3D model, it would not be viewable by anyone in a browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;



The downloadable version of the GLB files would require significant time and effort to re-uploaded and would be close to impossible to re-import these downloaded GLB file into our holo editor due to the data processing mechanism we have in place, let alone use it or resell it on the Bazaar.



Were someone to go to all of this effort to do such a thing would be a question of plagiarism, not a security issue.



Accusation of a Security Breach



We want to reassure all Players that there was never a security breach or leaking of customer data and if anyone in the community has additional feedback or concerns, we welcome you to share them with us so that we can continue to make Earth 2 better for everyone.



We have reviewed the contents of a zip file a YouTuber claimed proved a security breach and discovered the file was captured from one of our small test servers as a downloaded dump file in early August.&nbsp; It was not from our production server, did not link to any live data on our production server and did not contain any API keys linked to our production server or data.



We will continue to take any such accusations seriously and our team is committed to reviewing any reported security breaches that may exist in our website.&nbsp; We understand that some people can be very convincing and use their knowledge of software development to misconstrue issues to the public, but we would ask that anyone reporting such issues might follow an unspoken code of conduct between proactive software developers and quietly report potential security risks as opposed to broadcasting it across social media, luckily incorrectly in this case.



OTHER NEWS



Accidental Early Release of Martinique



We would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the accidental opening of Martinique, ahead of its scheduled opening time, which was a result of human error (setting the release time to 12AM instead of 12PM UTC). We understand any disappointment or confusion caused by this honest mistake and hope that those players who missed out on Martinique were able to be present for the opening of Comoros instead 24 hours after the intended release time of Martinique.&nbsp;



Opening the next new country on Tuesday the 13th of September was a decision we felt was best and fairest to all Players affected.



The next country release will be on the 19th of September and the following one two weeks later on the 3rd of October.



2021 Egg Hunt



Thank you to all Players who submitted their proof-of-entry for the 2021 Easter Egg Hunt! We have finished reviewing and updating the final winners and runners-up lists for all hidden 2021 Eggs, which are now available for you to check here.&nbsp; Our team will aim to award prizes over the next 2 weeks:&nbsp;



https://earth2.io/news/2021-egg-hunt



2022 Egg Hunt



Our team has continued monitoring social media for evidence of unfound 2022 Egg Hunt eggs, but unfortunately three of the Eggs from this year’s Egg Hunt have still not been found. The 2022 Egg Hunt has officially ended now.&nbsp; The remaining eggs will be rehidden in the next scheduled Egg Hunt which we expect to take place inside of E2V1.

Title: Over 50% of open Resource Claims Processed by the CAT &amp; 20M Essence Rewarded!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/09/17/e2prv-update/

====================================================================================================
18 September, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earlier this week the CAT (Claims Approval Team) reached a goal of having processed over 50% of the total open Resource Claims created by Earth 2 land owners.  Overall, the Earth 2 Player Resource Validation system (E2PRV) has been rewarding for those Players who have remained dedicated toward taking advantage of this very unique opportunity. 



In this article we will be sharing :




a general update on E2PRV&nbsp;



some key statistics so far&nbsp;



reminder on limestone, Essence reward reduction and more



a timeframe on when retroactive Essence rewards will be processed for Players who missed staking their own claim; and



we will also take a first hand look at how much dedication and effort the CAT puts into reviewing and processing resource claims.




GENERAL UPDATE AND STATS



Many Players have already improved future access to Resources on their properties, and increased their Essence balance, by receiving approvals for successful claims or staking Essence on approved claims for free! It has been inspiring for the team to see our community and sub-communities come together to collaborate, submit, and stake their Essence.&nbsp;



We know that many in the community have been curious about the ongoing stats for E2PRV, so we’ve listed out a few below! Since the E2PRV system was launched:



Over 1,200,000 unique stakes have been made (including Active, Approved &amp; Player deleted) &#8211; that’s over 19,000 stakes per day on average! (presently over 620,000 Active awaiting processing)



Over 13,500 Claims have been reviewed and processed by the CAT and our Claim Approvals System (with 11,700 Claims Active / Open at this stage)



A total of over 31,000,000 Essence has been utilised by Players for the purpose of staking



From which over 18,000,000 Essence is still actively staked pending approval or rejection



To date, more than 20,000,000 Essence has been earned by Players who successfully staked on claims which have been approved



There is a total of 126,000,000 Essence in circulation on the Earth 2 Platform today (this does NOT include Essence actively staked)



REMINDER ABOUT LIMESTONE CLAIMS, THE ESSENCE REWARD REDUCTION AND MORE



On the 31st of August, 2022, we announced that the limestone resource would no longer be claimable and that the Essence bonus rate would be lowered from 100% to 50%.  Again, we would like to reassure all participants that any claims submitted prior to the time our servers updated will receive the 100% bonus rate.  All subsequent submissions will be processed based on the 50% bonus reward rate. 



There will eventually come a time where we will cease the ability to submit new claims to give us time to clear the backlog and move forward with future steps.  At that point, all claims currently marked by the CAT (Claims Approval Team) as invalid will be officially rejected. 



We are leaving all invalid claims to be processed at the end in case any such claims happen to fall into approved resource areas while remaining claims are processed after the first cut-off date is activated.&nbsp; We earmarked a generous 3 month period for Players to be given a more than fair chance to claim resources they believed they were entitled to access on their land.



The CAT is updating all claims to “Under Investigation&#8221; as they move through the review process and this includes claims that are tagged to be rejected.&nbsp; We remind all Players that once a claim status is updated to “Under Investigation” by the CAT, it can no longer be removed or cancelled by the owner and the assurance fee plus any staked Essence on that claim will be locked until it is either approved or rejected.&nbsp;



As the E2PRV system was designed to benefit and reward Players who submit legitimate claims and stake to support legitimate claims, we want to be rejecting as few claims as possible.&nbsp; Our team has been impressed with the high level of detail, research and structure that has gone into the clear majority of most claims, so we look forward to rejecting as few claims as possible.



After the first claims cut-off date we may reopen the validation system for the submission of new resource claims.&nbsp; The validation system may be expanded to include other aspects of Earth 2 that will be relevant to various future Earth 2 plans.



RETROACTIVE REWARDS



During our E2PRV server update around the 31st of August, Players were provided the option to stake Essence on claims they created before the claim was published.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We understand that due to the popularity and highly competitive nature of the staking feature, some Players missed out on the chance to stake Essence on their own claim before this update was implemented.&nbsp;



At Earth 2, we strive to act with fairness, so after we reviewed how the previous process worked and took on board community feedback, we decided there will be a retroactive reward for all Players who created valid claims before the ability to stake Essence on their pre-published claims became available.&nbsp;&nbsp;



There are some important requirements that need to be met to receive this retroactive reward :




the Player must not have successfully staked Essence on that claim



the claim must have been approved



the amount will be the maximum amount of Essence a Player would have been able to stake on that claim based on the size of the Property the claim was created for



the Player must have had that maximum amount of Essence available in their Essence balance at the time the claim was created




These Retroactive Rewards will be processed between the 19th to the 23rd of September and will appear under “Retroactive Personal Claim Reward” on the Essence transaction page.&nbsp; Our calculations predict a little over 280,000 Essence will be Retroactively Rewarded as a result of this initiative.&nbsp;



AN INSIDE LOOK INTO THE CLAIM APPROVAL PROCESS



Have you ever wondered what process your claim undergoes from the time it is submitted by you, to the time it is approved by us? Each E2PRV claim is reviewed by our Claims Approval Team (the CAT for short) and the validity is rigorously checked by at least 2 team members before being officially approved or rejected. Due to the steep competition to stake Essence to the best claims, many interesting claims go unseen by the public.&nbsp;



Below, we have compiled just a very few of the interesting claims our team wanted to share with you.  Each approved claim is categorised into various groups depending on numerous details provided in the claim and based on our internal category system: 



(Please note that we are sharing these out of interest and Earth 2 reserves the right to approve or reject all claims which may be based on more details than what is provided below)



Legitimate, approved:







Claim #5693 &#8211; Mt Everest &#8211; World’s Tallest Mountain



Username: PLANTER (a3d929a1-6de1-4f5a-a46a-ca9ebc18b0df)



Location: Mt Everest&nbsp;



Resource: Limestone



Reasoning: The summit of Mount Everest was actually the seafloor 470 million years ago.The rock that comprises the &#8220;summit pyramid&#8221; or uppermost part of Mount Everest is gray limestone that was deposited on the northern continental shelf of northern India during the early to middle Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era, long before India began its northward journey towards Eurasia and the eventual collision of tectonic plates that uplifted the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau. Called the &#8220;Qomolangma Limestone&#8221; by geologists, the summit rocks are well-bedded limestone.&nbsp;

Claim #5421 &#8211; Muruntau Mine &#8211; World’s Largest Gold Mine&nbsp;



Username: 𝓒𝓐𝓡𝓛 (e94eb09d-2b5b-442a-9c11-854a2e6b9c06)



Location:&nbsp; Uzbekistan



Resource: &nbsp;Gold



Reasoning:&nbsp; Muruntau gold mine located in the Kyzyl Kum Desert of Uzbekistan is one of the world’s biggest open-pit gold mines. It has been in operation for more than 50 years. Discovered in 1958, the surface mining operations at the giant open-pit gold deposit started in 1967. The mine is 100% owned and operated by Uzbekistan’s state-owned Navoi Mining &amp; Metallurgy Combinat (NMMC).

Claim #7361 &#8211; Cacique Guatavita Lagoon &#8211; The legend of El Dorado



Username: FROMCOLOMBIA (bc143288-b4f5-439e-90a1-beb6ae1672e1)



Location: Columbia&nbsp;



Resource: Gold



Reasoning: The lagoon was one of the most sacred for the Muiscas , since the investiture ritual of the new Zipa was performed there ; according to legend, he was on a richly decorated reed raft; he had the entire body covered with gold dust; At his feet they placed a large amount of gold and emeralds to offer to the gods. The new dignitary was accompanied by four caciques and when the raft reached the center of the lagoon, the people who were on the shores threw gold objects and precious stones into the water. This is one of the origins of the legend of El Dorado . The famous Muisca Raft that is exhibited in the Gold Museum of the Bank of the Republic of Colombia is evidence that this type of rituals were celebrated in the lakes of the region.

Claim # 6329 &#8211; Aruba &#8211; Useless Islands



Username: hisheaven (2294832c-294b-4b98-be11-952ecf259277)



Location: Kingdom of the Netherlands&nbsp;



Resource: Gold



Reasoning: A common misconception is that the name Aruba came from the Spanish Oro hubo which means &#8220;There was gold&#8221;. However the Spanish found no gold on Aruba during the time of their occupation, nicknaming Aruba “Islas Inútiles”, meaning &#8220;Useless islands&#8221; due to the lack of gold. It was not until much later in 1824 that gold was found on Aruba by Willem Rasmijn, starting the Aruban Gold Rush. In 1824 gold was discovered in Bushiribana, giving place to the extraction of about three million pounds of gold in 1913.

Claim #9368 &#8211; Santa Domingo Mine &#8211; Tri Mineral Mine (Gold/Iron/Limestone)



Username: PurpleGro (175e341c-b0f5-4a35-b27f-4c6ba1504085)



Location:&nbsp; Chile&nbsp;



Resource: &nbsp;Gold/Iron/Limestone



Reasoning: &nbsp;Santa Domingo Mine is an historic mine which leads back to Roman times. This mine produced mainly Copper, Iron and Gold, however it has been proven that limestone can also be found through multiple links provided. About 25 megatons of ore had been extracted when the mine was closed in 1966 due to the Portuguese government threatening to bring in legislation making companies, especially mining companies, financially responsible for cleaning up their mistakes. This added another level of devastation in the region, as there was now an excess of people out of work due to the mine closure.

Mythological, Under Investigation







Claim #302 &#8211; Lost City of Paititi &#8211; “the lost world”



Username: HandspringGuy (312c6f72-068c-4049-89a6-5922721a7d30)



Location: Peru



Resource: Gold



Reasoning: In the document, which dates from 1600, Lopez describes in great detail, a large city rich in gold, silver and jewels, located in the middle of the tropical jungle called Paititi by the natives. Lopez informed the Pope about his discovery and the Vatican has kept Paititi’s location secret for decades.&nbsp;



Inca traditions mention a city, deep in the jungle and east of the Andes area of Cusco which could be the last Incan refuge following the Spanish Conquest. The Spanish conquistadors pillaged Cusco for its gold and silver

Location: Bolivia&nbsp;



Resource: Limestone



Reasoning: Cal Orck’o is a fossil bed in Bolivia. It is located in a limestone quarry approximately 4.4 km northwest of Sucre.The bed is composed of oolitic fossiliferous limestone, associated with large, freshwater stromatolites and nine levels of dinosaur tracks (trace fossils). The high-resolution mapping of the site from 1998 to 2015 revealed a total of 12,092 individual dinosaur tracks in 465 trackways. Nine different morphotypes of dinosaur tracks have been documented. Amongst them are several trackways of theropods, ornithopods, ankylosaurs and sauropods, with the latter group accounting for 26% of the trackways.

Title: A Well-Earned Break For Stakers: Earth 2 to Put A Pause On Validation Claims
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/10/13/e2prv-claims-paused/

====================================================================================================
13 October, 2022&nbsp; &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; To say the past 3 months has been anything less than intense for Players participating in the Earth 2 Resource Validation System would be a massive understatement. In the past we promised to provide a minimum of 3 months for Players to create Resource Validation Claims and we have now almost fulfilled that promise.



Just shy of 3 months ago, we released the first version of our player validation and Essence staking system; the E2PRV (Earth 2 Player Resource Validation). Since then, players have submitted over 56,045 claims for resource validation on their properties and almost half of these claims have already been processed by the CAT.



PLAYER VALIDATION SYSTEM TO BE PAUSED



Some Players, in particular, have dedicated an enormous amount of their time to this E2PRV Essence staking opportunity, with reports of some Players going as far as taking annual leave from work to focus on staking! We considered leaving the claim system open for a little longer than our 3 month promise, however, the health and well-being of our Players is important to us and we realised many of those participating have done so consistently with little to no rest.&nbsp;



Therefore, we will be pausing the ability to create claims at a random time during Monday the 17th of October, 2022 until further notice. This slight extension will provide Players with one final weekend to submit claims under the current Essence bonus system. We trust this pause will give Players the opportunity to take a well-earned break after 3 months of hectic staking.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Well done to Players who spent a great deal of their time participating. Rest soundly knowing you are not missing out on any staking opportunities, at least for the next little while. The 100% and 50% Essence rewards that were up for grabs over the past 3 months have been very unique and it is unlikely we will ever see such Essence rewards for future staking opportunities again, most certainly not over an extended period, as has been the case these past 3 months.&nbsp; This truly was a unique and special staking opportunity that we believe many will reminisce about in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;



There are plans to reopen our validation system at some point in the future, but you can expect key changes such as rewards, types of claims or uses, and adjustments to the approval guidelines which have been quite lenient for the initial E2PRV. Any changes will be announced prior to the reopening of the validation system.&nbsp;



We are aware that some Players, especially those with larger accounts, may not have been able to validate resources for all  of their properties, even though we made adjustments based on community feedback. It is our plan to allow some additional Resource Validation opportunities later on, under a new set of rules and a new, significantly lower, reward system.  In the meantime, Players should focus on enjoying their break from creating claims and staking Essence, as the CAT continues to process and evaluate the remaining active claims when the paws is in place. 



We thank all our Players for their participation and dedication to the E2PRV system thus far. You have demonstrated your strength as a community to collaborate with and support each other, which was especially evident with those who worked closely together.&nbsp; Having said that, many solo stakers were also able to stake hundreds of thousands of Essence collectively. Drop into our Discord if you’d like to talk to a few!&nbsp;



Your collective utilisation of the E2PRV system to validate and stake Essence has helped to inform our next steps towards modifying and expanding the system to encompass other areas of Earth 2, as has been the plan from the very beginning. We can’t wait for you to see what other opportunities&nbsp; this expanded validation system brings to Earth 2 Players over time.



INTERESTING E2PRV STATS TO DATE



Over 2,100,000 individual stakes have been made (including Active, Approved &amp; Player deleted) – that’s over 23,500 unique / individual stakes per day on average!



Over 26,000 Claims have been reviewed and processed by the CAT and our Claim Approvals System 



Over 58,000,000 Essence has been utilised (used) by Players for the purpose of staking.



From which over 31,000,000 Essence is actively staked or locked up, pending approval or rejection.



To date, more than 27,000,000 Essence has been earned by Players who staked Essence on successfully approved claims.



There is a total of 124,037,593.07 Essence in circulation on the Earth 2 Platform today (this does NOT include Essence actively staked).



Interesting Player Facts:

UPDATE ON MENTAR QUESTS AND NEW COUNTRY RELEASES



Our weekly Mentar gifting event has been extremely successful since kicking off in July, with 24,746 Mentars gifted to 18,802 unique players! While the event has helped these players to gain instant Mentars on their properties throughout Spain, Mexico, Chad, France, Egypt, Canada, Singapore, Ireland, New Zealand, Germany, Australia and the Netherlands, we have brought an end to this event in preparation for the upcoming PvP + EcoSim-intro feature. 



We will be sharing more details soon, but until then, this is a friendly reminder to collect your E-ther!&nbsp;



We have not forgotten about the 5 remaining countries left to open: Turkmenistan, Algeria, Paraguay, Hong Kong, and Saudi Arabia. We will be continuing to open these progressively, with the next release set for November. 



Along with more updates on the Earth 2 validation system, our birthday month is fast approaching and we will be sharing more news on our project during that time. If you haven’t already, be sure to keep updated by following us on socials!&nbsp;

Title: Earth 2 Turns 2!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/11/01/e2turns2/

====================================================================================================
November 2, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia – The month of November 2022, marks the second anniversary of the Earth 2 project and to kick start the birthday month, we have the following message from our CEO, Shane Isaac which includes a brief recap of the past 12 months and then what to expect throughout November and beyond:



Earth 2 is only in its second year of what will inevitably become an ongoing, multi-year commitment to achieve the dreams and goals we officially set out to achieve just 2 years ago.



While we understand that some of our supporters believe the project is not moving as fast as they would like, and with much of the progress being internal, it is inevitable things will appear or feel slow at times.  We do appreciate the patience and support from each and every one of you and while we are not claiming to have released any jaw dropping feature just yet, it is still noteworthy to point out that over the past 12 months we can still say we have made some clearly visible progress, such as:(Releases over the past 12 months)




The release of our custom built staking system via the Earth 2 Player Resource Validations initiative. A significant system that not only fulfilled a promise to ensure Earth 2 Players had a fair option to claim Resources on properties our resource data distribution system missed, but also one that provided unique opportunities for Players to benefit through participation.&nbsp; This system needed to work with mass data, at scale and passed its initial test successfully, recording over 2.1m unique stakes during the test period;





The release of Gold, Oil, Limestone, Coal and Iron resource locations on existing properties which included new additions such as the Resource Location Heatmap for resource rich properties (a significant release that needed to deal with mass data);





The internal release of our manual resource mapping system which not only allows our team to add resource locations around the world by drawing directly onto our internal mapping system, but also calculates requested actions inside that space and automatically processes them – for example, pending claims being automatically approved if they fell within the net of a newly attributed resource on the map. This is another core feature that will allow us to not only procedurally control actions that occur within areas of E2V1, but also manually determine areas for something like unit spawning or specific loot drop districts;





The release of the U2U HoloBuilding and Blueprint trading system which included numerous subsystems that are being improved to cater for not only future HoloBuilding creations, but also other digital assets, including User-Generated content;





The release of the completely revamped Bidding Hub V2;





The release of the fractional Essence system which saw the end of only integer Essence units and included a new process to claim E-ther and transform it into Essence.&nbsp; This system was created to pave the way for more relevant and adaptive spending constraints of Essence in the future;





The release of the Tier 3 Jewel system;





A custom built solution that enabled HoloBuildings to be fully processed from geojson into 3D Models;





Internal implementation of Business Intelligence reporting tools;





The release of Notification Hub v2;





Setting flags for each individual property;





The release of the Property Gifting system;





Numerous transitions to dark mode designs;





Adaptive grid default views;





A customised referral code system with higher refunds and discounts;





Various updates to the MarketPlace, Bazaar, Property Cards, Leaderboard;




In addition to the above feature releases, there were also many other changes, bugs fixes, optimisations and more – for a more precise list, please visit https://earth2.io/updates .



Moreover, it has not only been feature releases providing new details about Earth 2 over the past year.  There have also been numerous written and visual releases which revealed interesting information about various progress and plans for Earth 2, all of which were unknown 12 months ago, some examples being :(Other progress over the past 12 months)




The revelation of E2V1 which introduced the potential of Phase 2.5;





Visual demonstration of progress related to our Distant Terrain Engine;





Visual demonstration of multiple first tier EcoSim buildings (unique and customised by our internal team who designed each model from concept art, then 3D model, animated effects and built using our own technical process to ensure they can render in real time, at scale, inside the massive open E2V1 environment);





Visual demonstration of Player customisation of buildings and digital models;





Visual demo of Retail and Commercial buildings;





Extensive visual and audio information about the EcoSim, E2V1 and various core parts of future plans of Earth 2;





Visual proof of E2V1, its real time rendering capabilities and the fact we have applied the technology to the entire world – answering accusations that were constantly levelled at us claiming we had not yet built this technology;





Visual demonstration of the tile / property grid system perfectly matching into E2V1 which included evidence of the accuracy of our E2V1 geography&nbsp; when directly compared with real world mapping and satellite imagery;





The release of a 40 page Draft Whitepaper which included a clear indication of extensive information about future plans for Earth 2, the Essence token and answered many open questions from the community;





Numerous tweets, chats and videos from myself as the CEO of Earth 2, revealing or expanding on Earth 2 features, community questions and more.




In isolation over a 12 month period, these features, updates, and changes may not seem like much, and to some they may be regarded as unacceptable progress, but when summarised together it is clear to see the extent of the progress over the past year, much of which was shared with the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Notably, this list does not include the most recent few months where we have made significant advancements with E2V1 technology and also begun to build some of our first backend engines for the initial game mechanic systems which will pivot into E2V1 over time.&nbsp; It also excludes other work carried out by the Earth 2 team internally each and every week of the year.



All in all, for another challenging year where we are still finding our feet and our groove, especially with finding the right talent and right people for the Earth 2 project, not to mention having to change key team members at critical times, our team should be proud of the effort and results they have made.



What To Expect For The 2022 Earth 2 Anniversary Month



Looking back at our first anniversary month in November, 2021, there were two announcements loosely placed around updates.&nbsp; We certainly wanted to improve on that this year and although we still have an intense internal schedule of work, this year should be a clear improvement and will provide interesting written and visual updates about Earth 2.&nbsp; It will also include a couple of key updates to our website.



The list below provides the Earth 2 Community with an outline on what to expect throughout this month, with each item scheduled to provide additional information when that relevant announcement is made.&nbsp; We will not be committing to exact times or dates for each item below, apart from the E2V1 video which will certainly be the final announcement at the end of the month.&nbsp; Therefore, it is entirely possible that all of the below announcements or releases may occur in the final week of November, so please manage patience and expectations over the course of November as we work hard to share these exciting updates with you, your mind and body will thank you for avoiding unnecessary stress and disappointment.



The core theme for our 2nd Anniversary month is the revealing and information about near future key game mechanics, what they will look like and how they will function.&nbsp; Building a gamified platform like Earth 2 is a 5-7 year commitment from even an experienced and established game studio.&nbsp; While we certainly do not claim to be a well-known, established game studio, we embrace this challenge and long term commitment and feel our team is heading in the right direction.&nbsp; We expect to improve year on year, which we feel is already evident.



The list below is only meant to serve as a summary, more details on each item will be released throughout the month.



GAME MECHANICS



Over the course of the next month we want to share key details about four of the first core game mechanics for Earth 2.  These core game mechanics are special as they will first function on the Earth 2 website, but have been designed and will be built in a way that allows it to gradually migrate into E2V1, starting with the visual representation of actions and activities initiated on the website and then tracked and displayed inside E2V1.  Players can expect this migration to begin at some stage next year while our current focus is to have the website version stable and balanced.



The core game mechanics we will cover this month will be related to Droids, Raiding, Civilians and Contracts, with further details to come on each of these at the time the relevant announcement is made.



RAIDING &#8211; 1st ITERATION



This will mark the first release of the new Raiding feature on the Earth 2 website.  Our team is pushing hard to have this released by the end of November, or as close to that date as possible.  There are numerous unforeseen factors that may delay this release, but for now, we are following this timeline.



Around the same time Raiding is released, we will see the first new utility be added to Jewels.  6 existing, yet to be revealed Tier 3 Crafted Jewels will be the first group to receive the initial utility boost for Raiding.  This will introduce several unique slotting strategies enabling the skilled player to potentially outperform their peers.



NEW E2V1 FOOTAGE



We have new and exciting updates to share showing some of the progress our team has made with E2V1.&nbsp; As always, the footage will be in game and rendered in real time, demonstrating just how versatile and powerful our engine is.&nbsp; We don’t want to spoil the surprises, but we will be showing progress with our Close Up Terrain Engine working in real time together with our previously showcased Distant Terrain Engine.



For absolute clarity, while we plan to show some pretty impressive footage, we will be holding back on the full demonstration of certain elements to reserve them for release closer to the Essence Token launch.&nbsp; We feel this is a good balance between showing progress while saving the most excitement for that key future date.&nbsp; Having said that, there may be some teasers you can look forward to!



U2U HOLOBUILDING TRADING SYSTEM V1.1



The final parts of the U2U HB Trading System update v1.1 will also be released this month, which includes some exciting updates like ongoing Royalties for content creators, Limited Editions and more! Keep an eye out for more information to come on exactly what all the updates mean for you and U2U trading on Earth 2!



NEW EARTH 2 LANDING PAGE



Another key release for this month will be the completely revamped website for the Earth 2 Landing pages.&nbsp; Possibly even more exciting than the new design itself, will be the updated explanation, vision and presentation of information about Earth 2. There will be information to fill in the gaps, as well as never-before revealed details tying it all together.&nbsp;



SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM



Although the release for the Social Media Platform is running a little behind schedule and will not be released this month, we still plan to release some little pieces of information, the basic plan and maybe some sneak peeks at some of the general design this month.



100M TILE WINNER



We will be announcing the very lucky winner who purchased the 100 millionth tile on Earth 2! Not only is this lucky winner the owner of the 100 millionth tile sold from Earth 2, they have also won a very special prize which will be revealed in the announcement!&nbsp;



OTHER SMALLER RELEASES



There may be a few other smaller, but very welcomed, updates being deployed together with larger releases on the website over the next month and beyond.&nbsp; These would certainly not be significant enough to be included in the birthday celebrations, but they do warrant a mention as with the change of control over game design and more hands-on testing and review of existing systems, we are finding places where improvements have been overlooked.&nbsp; You will notice the first few of these updates on the property details page and the Jewel slotting page.



WITHDRAWAL STATS



Incredibly some people inside and outside of the Earth 2 community- predominantly outside- still falsely claim they cannot withdraw funds from Earth 2.&nbsp; We thought it might be a good opportunity to publish some official stats about withdrawal numbers during the celebration month.



COUNTRY RELEASES



We had originally intended to release multiple countries throughout this month&#8217;s anniversary, however, we are not committing to this and it is unlikely there will be more than one release.&nbsp; With the delay of the token launch we would like to provide more opportunity to buy in on country releases between now and the official release.



AIR DROP



There has been some speculation circulating within the community about a potential air drop this year.&nbsp; For absolute clarity, we do not have any airdrop scheduled, nor is it something that should be expected on any regular basis.&nbsp; As we announced back in 2021, the Essence Distribution Commitment (EDC) was a very special occurrence and similar events should not be heavily anticipated. Our E2PRV system also provided a significant opportunity for all Players to boost their Essence numbers and we feel for those who missed out on that opportunity, the upcoming Game Mechanics we are working to release will provide chances for those who want to put in the effort and remain active on the platform.



So for now and in the foreseeable future, we are back to Essence being very scarce and hard to come by, much like it was before staking.&nbsp; So logging in and collecting E-ther regularly from your properties is the best thing a Player can do currently and is the only way to increase your Essence balance right now.



TIER 3 LAND



There has also been talk about a potential Tier 3 land release, similar to how we released Tier 2 land last year.&nbsp; While at this point in time we do have plans to release Tier 3 land in the future, we do not have any plans for the short term release of Tier 3 land.&nbsp; If we released Tier 3 land it would be to provide an affordable starting point for new Players and would likely see an end to Tier 2 land sales with upgrades only being possible via Essence.&nbsp; Tier 3 land would also be significantly reduced in utility compared to Tier 2 land. We are not one hundred percent committed to releasing Tier 3 land as there are many other factors we need to consider before making such a decision. It is our main priority that if we release Tier 3 land, it is for a very specific purpose. For now, we just wanted to make it clear that Tier 3 land will not be released this birthday month



OTHER POTENTIAL SURPRISES



There are a couple of additional surprises we are working on which we are not committing to directly.&nbsp; Depending on a few factors, these may or may not be released this month. At the very least, they are something you can look forward to in the upcoming future.&nbsp;



Thank you again for being involved in our project, for your ongoing support and we look forward to enjoying this birthday month together, Earth 2!&nbsp;

Article 37
Title: Earth 2 Continues Support for Creators with U2U HB Trading v1.1 Update
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/11/11/u2uhbv11/

====================================================================================================
11 November 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 has demonstrated its ongoing support for Creators on its platform with the new release of the User-to-User (U2U) HoloBlueprint (HB) trading system v1.1! 



HoloBuildings are Earth 2’s experiment of creating tools to facilitate User Generated Content which then has a direct Utility in the game mechanics of our platform by allowing resource storage.  A HoloBuilding design is required before being placed on a property. Players can either try to create a HoloBuilding design themselves or purchase one designed by another Player from the Bazaar.



This updated version includes the introduction of Limited Edition HoloBuildings, the ability to resell HoloBuildings, Royalties for original HB creators, shareable URLs and HB galleries. These updates aim to improve the quality of User Generated Content trading on Earth 2, with a direct focus on rewarding Players for listing and selling their creations inside the Bazaar. 



Since launching the initial v1.0 of U2U HB trading, we have seen over 45,000 U2U sales in the Bazaar! Creators have been able to sell their creations for E$ (E$1 = $1USD) and either withdraw their earnings out of Earth 2 to their credit card or bank account or use the E$ to purchase other items and properties inside of Earth 2.



With the new addition of our Royalty system, Creators will be able to not only earn on the initial sale, as they have been to date, but also on any subsequent resale of their original creations.



Earth 2 has plans to expand this new trading system over time to include more than HoloBuildings, meaning core U2U trading features we release now will be applied to more digital assets and UGC traded on the same system in the future.  



This update also includes some other improvements from the new game design team that Earth 2 Players may find of interest, such as :




the Property Deed page now displays which Jewels are slotted 



an easier method to deploy or edit a HoloBuilding directly from the Property Deed page



we have also added a new quality filter to the Jewel Slotting and Crafting pages to make finding Jewels easier



display resources and the frequency of that resource on each Property when inside the Jewel Slotting page



the EPL bug has been fixed



the ability to load the Property Deed from the Jewel Slotting page and more.




The new team will continue to make small improvements when time permits, and we hope these ongoing small improvements help make like a little easier for the average Earth 2 Player.  To see a full list, please check out https://earth2.io/updates 



The U2U HB v1.1 release will require historic creators to be migrated to the new v1.1 system and this will include a specific process involving various steps and down time on HB trading in the Bazaar.  We urge all Players to read and understand this process which is listed toward the end of this article.



But first, read about the key details of each update below:



U2U HB TRADING V1.1:




Limited Edition Holobuildings




Limited Edition HoloBuildings will provide Earth 2 HB creators with more control over how many of their creations will enter circulation, meaning this feature allows HB creators to dictate how many copies of their HoloBlueprint designs are available on Earth 2 as HoloBuildings. What’s more, once a HoloBlueprint design is listed as a Limited Edition design, the seller/listing Player is providing an assurance that they will not list that Blueprint on the Bazaar again, as a separate listing.&nbsp; This is something Earth 2 Support will monitor but we feel most genuine creators will respect these rules to maintain a good reputation as a seller.&nbsp;



Limited Edition HoloBuildings will potentially increase value to HB creators for their unique designs and add a collectable aspect for Players looking to purchase these creations.&nbsp; What’s more, Players can make their properties stand out with these unique Limited Edition HoloBuildings and in the future will also be able to use and show their HoloBuildings in different ways.&nbsp;



To see HoloBuildings in 3D view, visit earth2.io/#thegrid, select Satellite-&gt;HoloBuildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Note: Limited Edition HoloBuildings will only be available for HoloBlueprints that have not been traded on the Bazaar during v1.0.&nbsp;




Ability to Resell HoloBuildings




Another important update to the HB trading system is the ability to relist a HoloBuilding license on the Bazaar. Whether you have changed your mind, no longer need the particular HoloBuilding for your designs, or simply like to collect and trade, Players can rest assured that the HoloBuilding licenses they bought can be resold. Now with limited edition HoloBuildings, Players will even be able to sell their unique HoloBuildings for a potential profit!&nbsp;




Royalties for Earth 2 Creators&nbsp;




Our new royalty system enables original HB creators to continue earning revenue from their designs, long after their first sale. It ensures that creators who make unique HBs in Earth 2 will be rewarded and reap ongoing benefits, not only from the first sale, but all future resales of their products.&nbsp; This will encourage Earth 2 creators to create better and high quality content if they expect to see strong resale figures for their creations.&nbsp;



Royalty rates are set at 3% of the sale price and cannot be less than $0.01. For HoloBlueprint designs which were made from the original design of multiple creators, each original creator will receive either 3% or an equal share of 12% total royalty if there are more than 4 creations in the new HoloBlueprint design.&nbsp;



To receive royalties from HoloBlueprint sales, a Player must be the original creator. A Player is considered an original creator if they designed and built a HoloBlueprint themselves. A Player who creates a new design completely or partially consisting of designs created by other creators, is not considered an original creator.&nbsp;




Shareable URLs for every HB listing




Shareable URLs let you promote your HoloBuildings anywhere on the internet! Market your designs to the entire world through any avenue of your choice.&nbsp; Try it out &#8211; you can even share your listings on our dedicated HB trading channel on our Discord!&nbsp;




HB Profile Gallery




The HB Profile Gallery allows Players to find all their original HoloBlueprint designs on their Profile page! No need to open the HB editor or go to your Resources inventory, now your Property and HoloBuilding assets can be found on your Profile page in an easy to view, fully accessible gallery. Your HB gallery will only show you the HoloBlueprints created by you. Once finding other Players on Earth 2 becomes more streamlined, you will be able to show off your creations and other Players will be able to visit your profile to see your original HoloBlueprint designs!



IMPORTANT STEPS for U2U HB v1.1 Deployment which includes a Bazaar Freeze



As many Players understand, the initial design of the U2U HB Trading System did not facilitate Royalty payments, Limited Editions and other items listed above.&nbsp; Due to the design of the system we were unfortunately unable to retroactively apply these features, which also meant that existing eligible creations need to be migrated to the new system.



The determining factor for whether a creation is eligible to migrate to the new system is mainly based on if that creation has previously been bought or sold to date.



The following criteria outlines which creations are eligible to migrate to the new trading system, and subsequently receive Royalties from its future sales:




Blueprints that have never been sold on the Bazaar;



HoloBuildings that have never been sold on the Bazaar; and



Items that have only been sold as a HoloBuilding on the Bazaar




Furthermore, only creations that have never been sold or bought on the Bazaar during v1.0 will be eligible for listing as Limited Editions.



Instead of requesting creators manually update their creations for v1.1, our team has developed an internal system that will automatically migrate eligible HoloBuilding and Blueprint license listings, without Creators needing to lift a finger.



There are a few steps that will be involved during this migration so as a summary, we have listed them below for your convenience :







The Bazaar will be frozen for HoloBuildings and Blueprints.&nbsp;



While the Bazaar is frozen a message will appear for Players with a link to the relevant news post(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;



The U2U Trading Update v1.1 will be migrated/rolled out from Stage 2 to Production.



All “eligible” Blueprints and Holobuildings will be updated to version v1.1&nbsp;



Royalties will be enabled for the following:

Blueprints that have never been sold;&nbsp;



Holobuildings that have never been sold; and&nbsp;



Where an item has only ever been sold as a Holobuilding.





Royalties will not be enabled for all other HoloBuildings and Blueprints yet



All Blueprints and HoloBuildings will be unfrozen and returned to the Bazaar




Once the update is complete, the Bazaar will be unfrozen and Players will be able to begin listing more creations. If you believe your HoloBuilding or Blueprint listing should qualify for receiving royalties but it doesn’t appear to be enabled, please contact https://support.earth2.io/ for assistance.



While these are still early days for our first iteration of sellable User-Generated Content (UGC) trading on our platform, we are continuing to work on facilitating more possibilities for Players to play, create, trade and earn inside the Earth 2 Platform. These updates to our HB trading system precede a more involved and complicated trading system which will be expanded in the future.



Thank you for taking the time to read through this update and we look forward to continuing on with our 2nd Anniversary Birthday month with more to come such as:




An article &amp; video explaining how the first iteration of Raiding will work, 



The 100 millionth tile purchaser and reward, 



An update on withdrawal stats, 



Details about how civilians will be introduced, 



A run-down of how Player to Player contracts will work, 



The launch of our new website landing page, 



An update on progress of our social media platform, 



A new country release, 



Updated footage on progress of E2V1, 



Other small updates and more!

Article 38
Title: Decimalisation Update
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/11/22/decimal-update2/

====================================================================================================
22 November, 2022, Sydney Australia &#8211; Today Earth 2 deployed an update not only to facilitate new game mechanics related to the upcoming Raiding feature, but also as a pre-emptive adjustment for future spending scenarios for E-ther and Essence.  



These adjustments will see E-ther receive two decimal points and Essence expand to 4 decimal points.



We’d like to share some details that Players may like to consider:




Properties will retain the same potential E-ther yield, but instead some smaller properties may notice more frequent smaller detection of E-ther as opposed to the previous method which detected E-ther in integers every ‘X’ number of days.



In order to keep the UI/UX clean, some locations may not always display Essence with 4 decimals places and E-ther with 2 decimal places



These are plans for our progressive, step by step adjustment to various decimalisation updates



As we get closer to the launch of the Essence token we will go through some final decimalisation updates



You may notice all E-ther claimed today will end with .00 values. This is due to today&#8217;s spawning of E-ther operating under the previous backend server logic and should change during tomorrows new process



You may notice that your Essence balance ends in .XX00. This is because your historic Essence balance is stored based on the previous logic. It should update to the more accurate decimalised value when you next transform your E-ther into Essence (we realise many Players are saving their E-ther in anticipation of creating Civilians).




Another update that went live was the landing page country price ticker which displays the cheapest available country prices.&nbsp; When you press on a country flag this will automatically take you to the last area in that country where new tiles were purchased.&nbsp; We will be adding an option in the future to allow Players to display different filtered results.



As always, if you have any issues with your account after a new update, please contact support via https://support.earth2.io/ or reach out to one of our friendly Community Managers on Discord https://discord.gg/earth2 



Thank you&nbsp;

Title: E$10,000(USD) Reward for the 100m&#8217;th Tile Purchased + 700% increase in P2P Jewel Sales
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/11/24/100m-tile-reward/

====================================================================================================
November 25, 2022 &#8211; Earth 2 has come a long way since launching in November, 2020, with 0 Players, 0 publicity and a few hundred dollars budgeted for advertisements. From then to now we have become a team that spans across Europe, Australasia, the UK, Asia and America, and earlier this year we sold our landmark 100 millionth tile!



And the Winner is ….!?



Without any form of public announcement or forewarning that there would be a reward for the Player who purchased the 100,000,000th tile, this winner will be receiving a retroactive reward in all regards, !&nbsp;&nbsp;



Without further ado, we would like to give a HUGE CONGRATULATIONS to:



Samjogo!







who has won E$10,000 &#8211; the largest single prize in Earth 2 history!&nbsp;



(E$1 &#8211; $1USD)



We’re not sure whether Samjogo will see this announcement, but once our accounting team adds the credit over the next 24 hours, Samjogo will have 10,000 reasons to smile when they see a little jump on their Earth 2 Player account balance!&nbsp;&nbsp;



We wanted to save this announcement for our 2nd anniversary month.&nbsp; We were under no pressure to reward the purchaser of the 100 millionth tile, but whether big or small, we enjoy rewarding Players that are active on our platform &#8211; so from the entire Earth 2 team, we hope Samjogo enjoys this massive prize and manages to turn it into something even bigger!



Fun fact: Samjogo changed their Player username so often, our concept art team stopped updating it on the announcement image after the 4th occasion!



700% increase in P2P Jewel Sales since Raiding Deep Dive Video



There has been a 700% increase in Player to Player Jewel sales on the Bazaar since the Raiding Deep Dive video was released earlier this week!&nbsp; The video confirmed that Jewels would have further utility inside the Raiding game mechanics by way of slotting to boost various attributes on Droids, and possibly more.



We can verify that there will be at least 6 pre-existing Tier 3 Jewels set aside with the unique distinction of becoming the first Jewels used to boost Droids. If you are new to jewel crafting, Tier 1 Jewels can be crafted into Tier 2 Jewels which can then be crafted into Tier 3 Jewels. It may be a strategy to hold onto your Tier 1 or Tier 2 Jewels before we release the names and exact boosts of the 6 Tier 3 Jewels planned to boost Droids.  There are currently a total of 38 Tier 3 Jewels.



Update on E-ther and Jewel Spawn Rates



Our team is aware of a delayed rate in the spawning of E-ther and Jewels across most properties.&nbsp; We are aiming to have all delayed E-ther and Jewels spawned over the next 24 hours.&nbsp; We would like to assure our Players that this is not a sudden reduction in spawn rates, but an unforeseen delay issue when testing a new mechanic.&nbsp; We are working to resolve the issue but there may be further delays over coming days. Please rest assured it will not jeopardise or skip any E-ther or Jewels that Players would normally receive from their properties, only delay it.&nbsp;

Title: Over $19M USD in Withdrawals processed by Earth 2
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/e2withdrawals/

====================================================================================================
30 November, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to announce it has officially processed over $19M USD in E$ withdrawals as of November 26, 2022.  This is an outstanding achievement for a project that launched only 2 years earlier and has grown to become the largest Virtual Land registry in the world.



Earth 2 allows people to buy, sell and trade virtual property based on real world geolocations which can produce a variety of digital items, some of which have currently utility now but will expand to have significantly more utility as the Earth 2 Platform expands.  This project experienced hypergrowth shortly after launching in November 2020, when the initial startup team was only numbered at a few full-time employees who were far from prepared for such unexpected growth. “Although we received a lot of public criticism, the biggest priority for us during 2021 was to ensure Earth 2 Players were paid out for their pending withdrawals which meant some other areas of progress across the project were not managed to the best of our ability.  Our team was too small and inexperienced to process the backlog, so we employed multiple senior accountants along with support staff to help clear the list”, said Shane Isaac, Founder and CEO of Earth 2.  “It was not as simple as just paying Players, we also needed to consider fraud, money laundering and a number of other international monetary compliance issues.  One of our solutions was to partner with Jumio ( https://www.jumio.com/ ) to ensure we complied with various KYC obligations that come with paying real money out to people who trade digital goods on our platform across different jurisdictions around the world.  While processing KYC for Players came as an additional cost to our business model, I was happy to absorb those costs and more if it meant we could efficiently, and legally, pay out Players waiting for their withdrawals”.



Earth 2 has since paid over $323,708 USD ($480,421AUD) for processing KYC checks to ensure we provide a safer and more compliant trading environment for our Players, but KYC is not the only cost associated with the withdrawal process.  Earth 2 pays an average of $8.21USD ($12.90AUD) in fees for each Credit Card to Bank Withdrawal, $7.72USD ($12.14AUD) for each Earth 2 Virtual Credit Card withdrawal and a $21.72USD ($34.14AUD) average cost to process problematic withdrawal requests. These fees do not include staff salaries or other administrative steps involved in the withdrawal process.



In addition to the above fees, Earth 2 continues to pay over $20 for each Earth 2 Virtual Credit Card setup, absorbing that cost to help Players who are unable to utilise other withdrawal methods on our Platform, to get paid out successfully.  



As of November 26, 2022, a total of $19,130,971.09 USD in withdrawals has been processed for Earth 2 Players all over the world, comprising of:




$13,542,436.33 USD via our automatic Credit Card to Bank Withdrawal System



$3,854,353.01 USD via our Earth 2 Credit Card System



$1,734,181.75 USD via other withdrawal systems




Earth 2 now employs 3 full time senior accountants along with numerous support staff who monitor withdrawals and Player trading transactions on the Earth 2 Platform for potential fraud and money laundering.&nbsp;



As of today, and for the past number of months, the Earth 2 team is thrilled to confirm we have had no significant backlog in Player withdrawals and our current withdrawals backlog sits at *zero.



We stand by our efforts to provide our Players with legitimate and fast withdrawals from Earth 2 and a compliant platform for Players to buy, sell and trade digital goods. We are always looking to improve and will continue to do so for the benefit our community to ensure continue to align with our Player-First ethos.&nbsp;

Title: Earth 2 Birthday Wrap-Up but Celebrations to Continue
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/e2bdaywrap/

====================================================================================================
December 1, 2022 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211; How quickly our birthday month draws to a close! Here’s a round-up of the updates and new features implemented and what’s still to come.



As promised, the first iterations of the game mechanics, including the lore, has been premiered, providing a preliminary look at the addition of:



✔ Droids &#8211; We’ve introduced the concept art of the various Droids which could be produced by Players for their use, including a basic explanation of their functionality.



✔ Raiding &#8211; The mechanics of Raiding with Droids has been outlined and early details of how they can be made, charged and used has been given. Raiding also provides additional utility to Jewels, on top of the current use in Slotting.



✔ Civilians &#8211; We’ve explained how to create and use Civilians and how they can be of advantage to Players with their ability to automate certain features such as recharging Droids to help streamline their Raiding activities. The specific skill of each Civilian makes them able to simplify a certain area of a Player’s account activity.



✔ P2P Contracts &#8211; With the addition of Player2Player contracts, certain aspects of the running of a Player’s account can be handed over to another person, whether they are a tile owner or not. This can provide huge help to those who have large accounts or those who simply do not have time to manage their account alone. This feature also adds a free2play element to the Earth 2 platform.



✔ U2U HB Trading System V1.1 &#8211; The recently launched User2User Holobuilding Trading System has given those with creative flair the opportunity to benefit financially from their artistic talent and the hours they dedicate to producing the many thousands of HBs and Blueprints which are currently available to purchase in the Bazaar. Later adding the ability to offer limited editions and earn royalties from the resale of a HB or BP. Hundreds of creators have already benefited from this monetary boost to their Earth 2 E$ balance.



✔ 100Mth Tile Winner &#8211; Early this summer the 100mth tile was purchased and Earth 2 promised a special reward to the buyer to mark this huge milestone. Samjogo, received the biggest single reward to ever be paid out by Earth 2 of E$10,000.



✔ Decimalisation &#8211; To facilitate many of the upcoming game mechanics. E-ther and Essence counts have been decimalised to 2 and 4 places. This will also add ease and functionality for possible future spending scenarios.



✔ $19M USD in Withdrawals &#8211; Most recently, we’ve announced that, as of November 2022, a massive total of over $19m USD was successfully processed and paid out to Players all around the world. After initial hypergrowth created a backlog of withdrawals, extra staff were employed and additional methods of withdrawal were implemented at our expense. This has ensured that Players can withdraw quickly, legally and efficiently, leading us to this date, where we have a current backlog of ZERO!!



In addition to the above, we are continuously improving and updating existing features to make them more user-friendly and efficient. For example, adding features to property deeds to make it easy to see/edit slotted Jewels, regular fixes and updates to the HBs Editor, updates for the map/grid view, various notifications and error messages added to help Players stay informed while using the site and many updates to filters and sorting options throughout the site which make the day-to-day maintenance and management of Player accounts easier.&nbsp;



All this while background development, Earth 2 Player Resource Validations and the basic running of Earth 2 continue to progress.



Unfortunately we did not meet all of our scheduled items throughout our 2nd Anniversary Month and we would like to especially apologise to all of our community for the delay of the updated E2V1 footage release.&nbsp; We plan to release the E2V1 footage on the 14th of December and will give ample warning about the exact time the video will be premiered.&nbsp;



We also expect to announce a new partnership with another startup which has made a great name for itself in the Metaverse space, a company that we plan to work closely with as we move toward the first release of E2V1 before our updated footage is released!



We have released a short teaser video which can be found here :&nbsp;









And here:https://twitter.com/theshaneisaac/status/1598040163380527104



And a more detailed explanation about the reasoning behind the delay of the E2V1 footage release can be found here:https://twitter.com/theshaneisaac/status/1598021707461459968



We plan to release a high level article over the next 24 hours which summarises Raiding, Droids and Civilians.&nbsp; This article will also include the first list of Jewels which will be utilised for Raiding and Droids!



In the meantime, we continue to work hard on delivering more amazing content and features including the much anticipated:



E2V1 footage &#8211; As mentioned in our birthday announcement, we still plan to show some really amazing footage, but still need a little longer before we’re ready to publish! Keep an eye out for teasers though!



Social Media Platform &#8211; We still plan to release bits of this over time and are, as always, committed to seeing this through to a successful release! We will also look to provide some sneak peeks as soon as we can!



New Earth 2 Website Landing Page &#8211; The new-and-improved website is still high on our list but needs to be launched after the E2V1 video is released and, we guarantee, that the information presentation on this revamped website is going to be well worth the wait!



Thank you again for your patience and support and we look forward to some of these delayed, yet still exciting, announcements to come throughout December!

Title: Earth 2 Jewels to receive more Utility with introduction of Raiding and Droids
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/12/01/jewelsboost/

====================================================================================================
December 2,&nbsp; 2022 &#8211; Brisbane, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to reveal the new utility that Raiding and Droids will add to one Tier 2 Jewel and a handful of Tier 3 Jewels!&nbsp; This update provides a clear demonstration of Earth 2’s commitment toward expanding the utility of existing digital items which can be earned inside of Earth 2.



Jewels are digital items that are collectible by owning land on Earth 2.&nbsp; Players are able to then craft different types of Jewels for different purposes and slot them into their Mentars or sell them to other Players for E$ (E$1.00 = $1.00USD) on the Bazaar.



Jewels will soon have further utility within the upcoming Raiding mechanics by allowing Players to slot them into Droids they own for a variety of different boosts.&nbsp; The Orange Jewel will add a building boost when slotted into the Mentar before it builds a Droid.



The additional utility provided to Jewels for Raiding and Droids will work on top of each Jewel’s current utility.&nbsp; Over time, Jewels will have numerous purposes and types of utility for different game mechanics, expanding their versatility and use for their owners.



We suggest that Players who own Jewels learn how to craft their Jewels into the type they require.&nbsp; Those who do not own Jewels are welcome to check the Bazaar for Jewels being sold by other Players, but we recommend to first consider the various boosts of each Jewel and to monitor the market prices before purchasing.



In addition to releasing the initial list of Jewels, we are very pleased to also give a sneak peek at the current boosts Players can expect from each Jewel!  Remember these boost amounts are subject to ongoing balance changes and adjustments!



We’re even more excited to announce that Raiding and Droids will bring the first new utility update to the corresponding Brilliant Jewels as well! 



Do you think the Brilliants effect is looking strange? It is not a typo! Expect to uncover new effects never experienced before! With the right conditions COPY will show just some of the additional power Brilliants hold! Over time, Brilliants will receive more additional powers and special abilities given they are the rarest form of Jewel on Earth 2!

Title: Protection of Earth 2 Customer Data
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/12/15/customer-data-protection/

====================================================================================================
Dec 16 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 takes the protection of its customers&#8217; data very seriously. In addition to regular code reviews and Quality Assurance (QA) processes, Earth 2 has also hired professional security experts since December, 2020, to identify any potential security vulnerabilities and work with our development team to ensure any such vulnerabilities are successfully resolved.&nbsp; Our most senior security officer is a senior security officer at one of the largest (Big 4) banks in Australia.



In addition to internal security and penetration testing, Earth 2 has been extremely conscientious when selecting the technology it works with to provide the safest possible security environment for its customers and to ensure that the least amount of personal or private details for its customers are stored on Earth 2 servers.



Earth 2 Credit Card Processing



Earth 2’s attitude to data security is first evidenced by its payment processing systems. Earth 2 uses a third-party Level 1 PCI-Compliant payment processing service. That service is operated through a PCI-compliant iFrame, which is hosted by the payment provider. The use of an iFrame allows Earth 2 to embed the payment provider’s payment page into its website, such that payment information is collected within the payment provider’s own digital environment. 



Earth 2 does not, and has never stored, any credit card details or payment details of customers on its servers.



Earth 2 &amp; auth0



Since its launch in November 2020, Earth 2 has always used auth0’s Universal Login and other auth0 features to store, protect and process its customers login details and passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



This system functions by the user opening an external auth0 login portal in order to login to Earth 2 before they are then returned to the Earth 2 website.&nbsp; Earth 2’s entire login system and process is directly owned, hosted and controlled by auth0.&nbsp;



After an Earth 2 user successfully logs in, auth0 returns the user to the Earth 2 website with a validation cookie and token in order to authenticate the session. Earth 2 does not, and has never, stored actual passwords for Earth 2 users on its server. Earth 2 opted to use this 3rd party service specifically for the protection of its users’ account credentials.&nbsp;



Earth 2 is a significant client of auth0 and has spent over $200,000 USD to ensure the safety of its customers passwords and the protection of access to their accounts.



To learn more about auth0 and the companies they work with, please visit: 



https://auth0.com/



Earth 2 &amp; Jumio



In order to comply with various international monetary regulations, Earth 2 is required to identify customers that trade for real money on our platform. This is to ensure we adhere to all compliance requirements for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (CTF) spanning various jurisdictions we operate in around the world. In order to identify users that want to trade and withdraw funds, Earth 2 works directly with the multinational online security company, Jumio.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Earth 2 has an integrated system which allows its customers to validate their identity and then trade with other Earth 2 users.  Earth 2 does not store any personal information on its servers as a result of the process as Jumio handles all the validations and approvals on their side.



Earth 2 users who do not wish to trade directly with other users for real money are not required to validate their identity.&nbsp;



Earth 2 has spent over $300,000 USD validating users who wish to trade with other users or want to withdraw funds they have made on our platform and is proud to ensure a safe environment for players to trade and withdraw.



To learn more about Jumio and the types of businesses it works with, please visit: 



https://www.jumio.com/ 



Earth 2 Two Factor Authentication (2FA) &amp; Google Authenticator 



Earth2 uses and has only ever used one authentication system, Google Authenticator, for authenticating Earth 2 users who have activated this feature.  Earth 2 opted to use Google Authenticator specifically to avoid the need for customers to use their mobile phone numbers for the purpose of 2FA.  Earth 2 has never used *phone numbers or text messages to process or validate any form of authentication. 



* This would also save anyone from ever having to buy a throw away sim card as the service has never existed



To learn more about Google Authenticator, please visit: 



https://googleauthenticator.net/ 



Earth 2 is committed to ensuring the protection and ongoing security of its customers&#8217; most private and sensitive data.  We hope the reassurance of the above measures illustrates that we take this commitment seriously and that we have been making conscientious decisions in the best interest of our customers since launching our service just over 2 years ago.

Title: Earth 2 and Ready Player Me Announce Strategic Partnership
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/12/20/ready-player-me-partnership/

====================================================================================================
Sydney, Australia | 20 December, 2022 &#8211; Earth 2’s strategic partnership with Ready Player Me means Players will be able to explore E2V1, the first version of Earth 2’s upcoming 1:1 digital replication of planet Earth, as customisable avatars much earlier than expected.&nbsp; The partnership was uniquely revealed as part of Earth 2’s recent video showcasing the development progress of its digital world.



“Ready Player Me creates great looking avatars that are importantly cross-platform compatible.  That was a big attraction for us at Earth 2 given our future plans of becoming a kind of centralised Metaverse. It will mean that not only could Earth 2 Players jump into other Metaverse experiences more seamlessly, but other people with Ready Player Me avatars can jump straight into E2V1.  All while representing the way you look or the way you want to look.  I think it’s very cool being inside a game with an avatar that reflects how you look in real life”, said Shane Isaac, Founder and CEO of Earth 2. “We’re super excited to continue working closely with the Ready Player Me team and look forward to our teams cooperating next year with Ready Player Me’s plans to improve certain technical aspects of their software and the future opportunities we can unlock together”.



Ready Player Me avatars can be created from a selfie. From there, users have access to hundreds of customisation options to make their cross-platform compatible avatar truly unique. Ready Player Me avatars are currently supported in over 5,000 apps and games. Earth 2 is committed to bringing an immersive and unbounded metaverse experience to new and existing Ready Player Me avatar owners.&nbsp;



“We are excited to partner with Earth 2 and offer its community access to our interoperable avatar system,” said Timmu Tõke, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Ready Player Me. “Earth 2 is shaping to be another great Metaverse destination for Ready Player Me avatars. We are looking forward to seeing our users exploring it with their personal digital identities.”



At its core, the partnership between Earth 2 and Ready Player Me will center on continuing to improve interoperability and performance of the avatars inside the massive E2V1 3D world, with particular focus on allowing large numbers of avatars to load inside single scenes or areas.&nbsp;



“The tech team of E2 has very difficult challenges to solve, given the scope of our ambitious project. We were more than happy to adopt the best cross-platform avatar solution out there and it also means we don&#8217;t have to sacrifice manpower toward developing a system ourselves yet”, said Peter Rößl, Lead Game Developer of Earth 2. “With the upcoming introduction of LOD(Level of Detail) optimizations to Ready Player Me, I believe that we can reach our performance goals, while rendering a large number of concurrent players on screen. Thanks, Ready Player Me!”



Earth 2 plans to incorporate Ready Player Me avatar creation into its website through 2023 to allow its Players the ability to start creating and customising avatars they will be able to use inside of Earth 2 Version 1 (E2V1).



For more press related information regarding this partnership, please contact pr@earth2.io and a representative from Earth 2 will reach out to you.&nbsp;

Title: A Unique Gift Idea, just in time for Christmas!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/gift-the-metaverse/

====================================================================================================
December 23, 2022 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; As we quickly approach Christmas and other end-of-year celebrations, we are reminded with the art of giving. So, what better way to finish the year than by giving someone a gift from the future? Earth 2 has recently tweaked its gifting system so whether you are stuck on a gift idea, or you simply want to share your love of the Metaverse with someone you know, you can buy virtual real estate on the biggest virtual land registry in the world and give them their very own piece of it!



GIFTING LAND TILES IS BOTH INTERESTING &amp; UNIQUE



Gifted land holds all the same perks as if you were buying the land for yourself with the current ability to build a Mentar, detect, collect and transform E-ther into Essence, the chance to detect Jewels and in the near future build Cydroids to raid E-ther from other properties, synthesize Civilians, convert resources into raw materials, build on the land and much, much more.



After 2 years of development and having recently shared progress on the development of our 3D world, E2V1, we plan to release pre-alpha access some time throughout 2023, so this is a very exciting time for anyone to get involved and own a piece of the Metaverse!!



WHAT IS GIFTING?



Gifting land tiles is when you purchase a property from Earth 2 and send it to a lucky recipient of your choice. Anyone with a free Earth 2 account can gift virtual real estate in the form of land tiles, whether the giftee has an existing account or not. You can choose to pay using your credit card or one of over 120 crypto currencies supported on our website!&nbsp;



However, you choose to gift virtual land, we’ve made it super easy. Don’t have an account? That’s okay, it’s quick, easy, and free to sign up!&nbsp;

HOW TO GIFT LAND




Select the tiles from the map on the BUY LAND page:



Our new system does not require you to enter an email address of the recipient, simply select &#8220;Do not notify the recipient&#8221; and anyone you share the gift code with can redeem it.



Select “This is a gift”









Select whether you would like the recipient notified of their gift:

Yes, notify the recipient:

The recipient has an account: enter their Earth 2 username



The recipient does not have an account / username unknown:&nbsp; enter their email address





No, do not notify the recipient:

The gift code will be sent to you to personally hand out to the recipient, or you may take a screenshot on the property deed page and share that with your lucky friend!







Select your payment method. Buying land is so easy with these 3 options:

Pay with account balance 



Pay with credit card&nbsp;



Pay with crypto (new!)&nbsp;






Once you have successfully purchased your gift, you can find the property saved in your Player Profile, distinguishable from your other properties by its bright pink icons.&nbsp;







Clicking on the pink gift code button reveals the code, which you can gift to your lucky recipient. The property will stay on your profile until your gift recipient claims their gift using the unique code. If your gift recipient does not claim their gift in 30 days , the property ownership will permanently transfer to you.&nbsp;



Now that you know how to gift land in Earth 2, what are you waiting for? With new utility being constantly added to land and digital assets in Earth 2, there are more and more things for Players to discover. Earth 2’s 3D digital world will be playable as a pre-alpha in 2023 so make sure you’re ready for it!&nbsp;

Title: Raiding, Cydroids &amp; Civilians High Level Summary
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/raiding-details/

====================================================================================================
December 24, 2022 &#8211; Brisbane, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 recently announced the scheduled introduction of 4 new game mechanics. Raiding, Cydroids and Civilians make up 3 of these new mechanics and this article will cover a high-level summary on each one to ensure Players have a clear understanding on what to expect.



Each game mechanic is related to one another but also have a future place inside of Earth 2, especially inside E2V1, our 3D world.  Aside from their future representation inside E2V1, these game mechanics bring significant new utility to E-ther, Essence, Jewels and land.&nbsp; In this article we will predominantly focus on the short-term objective of the 4 new game mechanics functioning together to deliver the ability to Raid on Earth 2.



Raiding will be easy to play but difficult to master.&nbsp; It will be simple to build Cydroids and synthesise civilians and then use them to conduct raids, but whether you are running a small operation or a massive empire, you’ll need to carefully consider various strategies to get the most out of your Cydroid fleets during the E-ther Wars.







RAIDING &amp; CYDROIDS GUIDE OVERVIEW




Properties of 4 tiles or larger with an existing Mentar can build Cydroids and launch Raids on other properties nearby with the objective of gaining E-ther that has become unstable due to not been collected within a 24-hour period after it spawned



Players can build Cydroids for 2.5 Essence each and a default build time of 24 hours.&nbsp; Cydroids are tethered to a Mentar during the build time.



There are over 35 different types of Metasprites a Mentar could capture to build into Cydroids, grouped with different levels of rarity.&nbsp; The type of Cydroid will only be visible once the Cydroid build is complete.



Cydroids will have a default Raiding distance of 1km and a default speed of 20km/h



Cydroids require a Power Cell to operate. Power Cells are currently located inside the Cydroid but will later be a separate standalone unit.



Power Cells require Essence to be Powered and operational.&nbsp; Cydroids will require 5 Essence to be powered which is fully regainable (see point 7).



All Essence used to Power a Power Cell can be 100% recovered by the Player if they Depower the Power Cell in a fully charged state.



At present you only need a Mentar and time to recharge the Power Cell inside your Cydroid.&nbsp; You do not need Essence to recharge the Power Cell inside the Cydroid.



Once your Cydroid is Powered, you can send your Cydroid to Raid a property that is within raiding range and it will scan that property for any unstable E-ther as long as it has enough Power to do so



If the Cydroid is unsuccessful in collecting E-ther, it will return back to the Mentar it was sent from



If the Cydroid is successful, it will collect as much E-ther as it can hold or has enough energy left to collect and return back to the Mentar it was sent from. The default storage bay on a Cydroid will hold 3 E-ther.



If there is more than one Cydroid scanning on the same property when unstable E-ther becomes available, they will split the E-ther loot evenly



The smallest particle of collectable E-ther is 0.01, therefore, if there are multiple Cydroids simultaneously present at the time E-ther becomes unstable and an even split is impossible, a random algorithm will determine which Cydroids win the available loot



When a Cydroid returns to the Mentar, it will become available to dispense any E-ther it has collected and stored in its storage bay.&nbsp; Cydroids may raid again without Dispensing E-ther but this may reduce the amount of E-ther they can collect if their raid is successful.&nbsp; The default time to dispense E-ther is 30 seconds per 0.01 E-ther.



A Cydroid can only be recharged at the Mentar.&nbsp; If a Cydroid runs out of power at any point during a Raid, the tethered connection with the Mentar will allow the Mentar to use this connection to pull the Cydroid back, albeit at an extremely slow pace



A Cydroid can be relocated between inter-networked Mentars (Mentars that belong to the same Player)



Travel between inter-networked Mentars requires less Power than Raiding, therefore Cydroids can travel longer distances to relocate.&nbsp; The default relocation Range for a Cydroid is 300 km



Cydroids need to re-Tether to a Mentar once they relocate in order to sync with the force and knowledge of the Mentar as part of their preparation to Raid in that area



Cydroids have numerous different energy consumption states that drain different amounts of Power cell charge. These states are: Idle, Recharging, Dispensing E-ther, Scanning, Collecting, Travelling to a Raid, and Relocating between Mentars.



Cydroids can be slotted with various types of Jewels to give them various types of Boosts across most of their various attributes








Civilians Quick Guide




Civilians will help automate the operation of various Raiding tasks from the Mentar, removing the requirement of the Player to carry out each task manually



In the near future Civilians will be synthesisable via the Mentar on properties of 4 or more tiles and above using E-ther.



Civilians will require 20 E-ther to be synthesised



The Mentar picks up transmissions of DNA which are diverted to the Synthesis Chamber inside the Mentar and fused with the E-ther to create 1 Civilian over a period of 24 hours



There are initially 3 different factions, each with 5 civilian characters



Civilians will have different levels of rarity.&nbsp; The type of Civilian synthesised will only be known once the synthesising process is complete.



Civilians are always synthesised in the same order based on their default profession.&nbsp; That order is Data Analyst, Cydroid Technician, E-ther Dispenser (Reckoner), Raid Commander and Cydroid Pilot.



The Data Analyst will unlock Raid Insights for the Property on which they reside and the Cydroids tethered to that Property.



The Cydroid Technician can automatically recharge any idle Cydroids inside the Mentar.



The E-ther Reckoner can automatically dispense any Cydroids carrying E-ther in their storage.



The Raid Commander can send Cydroids to automatically re-raid properties.



The Cydroid Pilot will be able to fly Cydroids on special types of missions with various objectives.




The above high-level summary was a quick and easy introduction into what Raiding is, what Cydroids do and how Civilians will fit into the mechanics.&nbsp; In the future we plan to allow Players to trade their Cydroids and Civilians for E$ on an open marketplace, much like we do for Jewels and HoloBuildings.For those of you who would like to read more details, some of which are already covered above, please feel free to read on!



FURTHER BACKGROUND ON RAIDING, CYDROIDS and CIVILIANSIn the current Earth 2, E-ther is considered a valuable resource &#8211; a resource that can be transformed into Essence, the currency representing power within our metaverse, and a resource that will be able to create virtual life. Raiding is a feature that enables players to rely on tactics and strategy to benefit from inactive players and take E-ther that they fail to collect in time. The overall concept of raiding relies almost entirely on one of Earth 2’s upcoming features &#8211; Cydroids.



Cydroids are semi-sentient machines that are created by the Mentar. They are constructed from the likeness of Metasprites, which are ethereal beings that roam the lands of Earth 2. This is because the Mentar essentially uses the Metasprites as a blueprint for the construction of the sprite&#8217;s physical Essence-based form. Once its Cydroid body has been fully manufactured, the meta-sprite is able to reside within its new form and implement a range of unique and useful abilities.Metasprites appear to have an unexplainable connection to Mentars, which give Cydroids the unique ability to hack into a Mentar to detect E-ther on a property. An important thing to note is that Cydroids can only detect E-ther on a property if it evaporated at the start of the previous E-ther production cycle. After being constructed at a Mentar, Cydroids are ‘tethered’ to that Mentar. While at the Mentar, each Cydroid is able to recharge, go on a raid, and dispense E-ther. Each Cydroid also has the ability to relocate a certain distance, and tether to other Mentars that the player may own. Additionally, Mentars appear to have different capabilities for supporting Cydroids depending on the size of their properties &#8211; a Mentar on a property with less than 4 tiles cannot support any Cydroids, and one on a property of 750 tiles can support 10.



The capabilities of Cydroids essentially allows players to build Cydroids on their properties and initiate raids on nearby enemy properties, taking E-ther from all targeted players that fail to collect their E-ther in time. Players who have built Cydroids will thus be able to treat the world as a chess board and strategically manoeuvre fleets of Cydroids to skyrocket the rate at which they obtain E-ther.



There are many types and appearances for Cydroids within Earth 2, determined by the ‘skin’ of the Cydroid that is crafted. Not much is known yet about the differences between the Cydroid skins &#8211; except from looking cooler than others. As more features start to be included in Earth 2, be prepared to find out that your plain looking Cydroid is actually classified as an interceptor or your classy gold Cydroid is an exploration Cydroid! Whilst current Cydroids are only fixated on the raiding system, there is much more functionality to be implemented in the future, both as expansions on raiding itself, and as an introduction into PvP and other features relevant to open world exploration.



The second feature relevant to raiding are Civilians. Civilians are synthesised lifeforms whose sole purpose is seemingly to obey and serve the player by carrying out tasks assigned to them. In the initial release of the raiding feature, there will be a maximum of 5 civilians per property. These properties will require a minimum of 4 tiles if they are to be populated by civilians. The tasks in question heavily depend on the occupation assigned to each civilian which will currently be determined by the order in which the civilians are synthesised on a property.&nbsp; For example, the first civilian synthesised on a property will always be allocated the data analyst position. These occupations are:




Data Analyst



Cydroid Technician



E-ther Dispenser



Raid Commander



Cydroid Pilot




Depending on the occupation of the civilians, they will be able to unlock certain raid related features such as providing raid insights, auto-raids and more. This only marks the beginning of civilian utility, and as more gameplay features are released, there will surely be a higher demand and opportunity to automate various additional tasks that come with land ownership. Players should not grow too accustomed to managing only 5 civilians, especially as these new features are only scratching the surface of what&#8217;s to come. Civilians also belong to a range of different factions each with their own unique cultures, beliefs and aesthetics. For the time being, it appears that civilians have no meaningful recollection of being associated with these factions. It is assumed that the loyalty of Civilians to their owners and their properties will never waver, and they can be relied on by the player to carry out their appointed tasks dutifully.&nbsp;



Raiding Deployment to Stage 2 Server



Over the next 48 hours we hope to deploy the first version of Raiding with Cydroids to Stage 2 ( https://stage2-app.earth2.io/ ).  This 48 hour timeframe is an indication only, there may be delays if we run into devop issues. &nbsp;If you happen to see the update on stage 2, please be aware that there will be a transition period when the update occurs which could take time to ensure all new systems are working together correctly, so we will notify the community via Discord when it&#8217;s ready to test. 



Once it&#8217;s ready we will be inviting any interested Earth 2 Community members to sign up on Stage 2 and help us to do a broader test before we deploy to production.&nbsp; It is important to note that the new Raiding and Cydroid game mechanics are operating on a completely new back-end system which we will be deploying to stage 2 for the first time.&nbsp; We have built this new system as it should scale better over time. However, as with any new devops or back-end solutions, they can take time to balance.



Please see the below list of things to consider if you decide to help us test on Stage 2 :




If you need to add E$ credit to Stage 2, simply use our dummy data credentials 5555 5555 5555 4444 for MasterCard and 4111 1111 1111 1111 for Visa.



If any game mechanics stop working suddenly, there is likely an issue with our new backend system and our devs will review the problem.&nbsp; This might mean a 10 minute interruption to testing or a 2 day interruption.&nbsp; We cannot predict how long something might take to fix or adjust, but if there is a longer delay we will try to relay this via our CMs when the back end system is working correctly.



If you find a bug or experience an issue, feel free to provide feedback via our Discord in the #raiding-stage-2-bug-reports channel. This is completely voluntary, our QA team will be conducting further tests including a full smoke test prior to any deployment to prod. Our CMs will relay issues back to our dev team and we will prioritise and fix accordingly prioritising feature deployment blockers.



We are limiting the number of Cydroid types on Stage 2 to only five types, and all will be Common rarity.&nbsp; The other 30+ Cydroid types of varying rarities will be released later when Raiding is ready and deployed live to production.



If your Cydroids do not receive E-ther during a Raid, it may mean that the property you raided did not have any E-ther to collect.&nbsp; Remember, you cannot see whether a property has E-ther or not. If you do find a good target, maybe save it as a favourite!



We want to release Raiding in steps, with the least complication as possible, especially for our new back end system. Therefore Cydroid Management and Jewel Slotting will not be available in the first release.&nbsp; Those will come after we ensure the first release is stable on production, and while the first release might appear simple, there is a considerable amount of work taking place in the background to ensure this first version is stable.



All feedback and suggestions will be taken on board, but our main objective is to get Raiding onto our live production servers as quickly as possible so our main focus will be on fixing critical bugs that are blocking a full release.



Cydroids will normally take 24 hours to build, but we&#8217;ve reduced the time to 2 minutes for stage 2 to make it easier for Players to test




IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT BOTS



Any bots that automate any part of the Raiding game loop are strictly prohibited. Any Players found to be using a bot, risks having all of the E-ther or Essence they have gained by Raiding removed from their account and potentially face further account restrictions.



Disclaimer for all Players, Stage 2 is our test site and any E$ credits, E-ther, Essence and digital assets on Stage 2 are not real, nor shall be recognised as such on our live site. Any values stated above and associated with Raiding, Cydroids, and Civilians may be adjusted over time for the purpose of balancing game mechanics.

Title: Raiding &amp; Cydroid Update + Green Light on Stage2
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/02/24/raiding-update/

====================================================================================================
February 22, 2023 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211;&nbsp; Earth 2 is pleased to announce an official “Green Light” for Raiding on our pre-production server, Stage 2 (&nbsp; https://stage2-app.earth2.io/ ).&nbsp; Players who have test accounts on Stage 2 are invited to try out the newly developed Raiding feature and report any issues in the #raiding-stage2-bug-reports channel on our official Discord server https://discord.gg/earth2 .&nbsp;&nbsp;



A few guidelines for testing are listed at the end of this article so for those helpful volunteers who wish to test, please read these guidelines carefully.



Raiding is the First StepThough the Raiding concept may look simple at first glance, it has been built to function across the entire globe, and there are a surprising number of potential strategies waiting to be discovered for Players seeking success.



The Cydroids’ base specs for Raiding Version 1 may seem quite limited to Players, but based on our internal calculations, even base spec Cydroids can be highly effective and achieve great returns on E-ther. It is also important to note that these base specs are far from the true potential or final capacities of the Raid Cydroid, especially once boosts from Jewel Slotting become available. 



The Raiding feature is an introductory first step leading towards many more, highly-anticipated components and features of our EcoSim.&nbsp; Therefore, this release will not only bring rewarding gameplay to Players, but also allows us to test and improve the core engine that will be responsible for the processing of Earth 2 EcoSim game mechanics .



While Raiding may seem like quite an ordinary feature to some, under the hood we have developed a lot of new, core mechanics that have been designed and built to facilitate many features released in the future. Some of the factors carefully considered were :




That Raiding is designed to be a fully-functioning, global logistics solution that is able to track millions of assets (in this case, Cydroids) all over the world. This  includes knowing their exact locations, the amount of fuel / energy they have, how they interact with each other, competition between Cydroids at the same location, numerous Raiding statuses, and more, at any given time.



The 3D models of all Cydroids (As seen on the recently released E2V1 Tech Demo video ) were fully completed, along with many other 3D assets that are currently being worked on behind the scenes. 



The set of complex energy models that most objects ranging from Buildings, Vehicles and Cydroids, to Equipment, will be subject to. This energy mechanic alone could see Players specialising in it on a much deeper level later on. This entire system begins with the small and humble Micro Power Cell used to Power the Raid Cydroids.



RBAs (Rewards, Badges &amp; Achievements Tech tree) which are a new Rewards system set to be released shortly after Raiding Version 1 is live. RBAs can come in many forms and differ in availability, type of reward, and achievement requirements. For Raiding we will soon release a pilot Reward, and later, Badges &amp; Achievements too. Some RBAs will be rare and can only be unlocked by a few Players, while others will be possible to unlock for all. Some will be passive rewards and others active, some permanent, some temporary, etc. The RBA for Raiding will mark the beginning of the RBA tech tree which will become vast over time and encompass various secrets.  The pilot reward set aside for Raiding will be a very interesting one.



The plan for Raiding and the upcoming EcoSim is that they will start out in a Web2 based fashion, but they are simultaneously being prepared and tested for the transition into the 3D space of E2V1.



In parallel to the Jewel boosts Cydroids will receive, as part of the Raiding feature, the Jewel system itself has been undergoing a further design rework where all existing 41 colours will have their own unique characteristics, lore and utility. To say which one is better than the other will depend on the Player&#8217;s specialisations, strategies and goals. Jewel boost functions will begin with Raiding but will expand to a much bigger scope and gradually, we will introduce the new and unique effects these Jewels will offer. 



The introduction of Raid Cydroids as the first type of Cydroid as one of the best options for kicking off logistics and conflict within Earth 2. Each subsequent type of Cydroid will come with its own unique set of capabilities and specs. Players can look forward to the next set of Cydroids being introduced with the upcoming Ecosim, but should expect that it will also become more difficult to obtain these Cydroids in the future.  




All of these core mechanics create a strong and expansive foundation for the EcoSim which, in itself, is only a single component of the broader Earth 2 experience. Raiding is not only an excellent feature to pilot new foundational mechanics, but it is another example of a&nbsp; feature which offers potential rewards to our early and faithful Players, something that we feel very strongly about.



Deployment to Live Production Servers



This release of Raiding will be considered as Raiding Version 1 and our primary focus will be to identify and fix reported bugs on Stage 2 before deploying to our live production environment.



We will not release any public announcement when Raiding Version 1 is deployed and live on our production website but rather silently deploy to monitor it for a number of days. Only after our developers confirm they are happy with the deployment will we publicly release an announcement confirming Raiding Version 1 is live on production.&nbsp; This may take days, or weeks &#8211; we cannot commit to a time frame &#8211;&nbsp; but please rest assured we are pushing to get this live.



As with any new feature release, there are numerous unforeseen issues that may arise.&nbsp; Our team does their best to mitigate these issues, but edge cases are sometimes unavoidable, especially with a larger release like Raiding.&nbsp; As with other releases where issues were identified and ultimately fixed, our team will be on standby to actively resolve any that may arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We ask for your patience and understanding during this period as negative and abusive comments do not help to fix or resolve anything.



Testing Guidelines for Community Volunteers



We are grateful for the community’s willingness to help in the testing of raiding. While all suggestions are welcome, our key focus is to get raiding live in a timely and stable manner.&nbsp;



Therefore, to help us focus on the more critical issues, please ensure you identify whether your listing is a #bug or #suggestion in the Discord channel.&nbsp; Internally, there are already improvements on our radar which will be rolled out over time, and while we always welcome community feedback, we will be predominantly focusing on fixing bugs blocking a production release.&nbsp;



Before reporting a bug or suggestion please scroll through the channel to see if your issue has already been reported. Be aware that Cydroids created on the previous version from December might display unexpected behaviour. To avoid any doubt, build new Cydroids.



It is very important to mention that Stage 2 is configured to build Cydroids in 2 minutes to help volunteers test faster.&nbsp; When Raiding Version 1 is live on production, build time for Cydroids will be set at a 24 hour base build time.



We should also note that as a reward to early Raiding participants, we are going to allow concurrent building of Cydroids on properties.&nbsp; This means if you build 4 Cydroids, for example, all 4 will build concurrently as opposed to the Mentar only being able to build one at a time. We have not decided when this promotion will end.&nbsp;



Please use the following format when reporting to ensure efficient communication with our development team:



&lt;Bug/Suggestion&gt;: &lt;Descriptive title&gt;



&lt;Description&gt;



&lt;Steps to reproduce&gt;



&lt;Actual outcome&gt;



&lt;Expected/desired outcome&gt;



&lt;Attached Screenshots/Screen recordings&gt;



Example report:



Bug: Relocating a Cydroid to a property in Gibraltar is impossible



Description:&nbsp;



When trying to relocate a Cydroid to a property in Gibraltar an error is thrown. The target property is within range and has a Mentar.&nbsp;



Steps to reproduce:

Article 48
Title: Cydroid Rarities &amp; Property Trading Protocols
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/03/05/cydroid-property-trading-rarities/

====================================================================================================
5th of March, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; As we draw closer to the live release of Raiding, we felt it necessary to highlight some very important aspects for Players to consider, especially if you plan on selling properties that are acting as Raiding launch pads or have Cydroids tethered to them.  Therefore, this article is incredibly important to read for any Player intending to Raid or build Cydroids and will also cover details about Rarities, how that will work and how it will provide early access privileges for active Players.







Property Trading Protocol for Cydroids







It is incredibly important for traders to understand that for a number of reasons, properties with Cydroids tethered to them will be sold collectively, with any Cydroid/s tethered to the property at the time of listing on the Marketplace.



Cydroids cannot simply disappear when a property is sold as they must be tethered to a Mentar at all times. Therefore, when selling a property that has Cydroids tethered to its Mentar, the Cydroids (including all of their assets such as Essence held in Power cells and raided E-ther in storage) will be part of the property sale. 



Players do have the option to relocate their Cydroids to another property before they place their property for sale on the Marketplace, if they do not wish to include Cydroids and their digital assets in the sale. Care must be taken if you are currently accepting bids for your properties, that you do not accept a bid before checking for tethered Cydroids, as any Cydroids actively tethered to that property along with their assets will be transferred as part of the sale.&nbsp;



The following list specifies the activities that will continue and activities that will be aborted when a property with tethered Cydroids is sold:



Activities that will continue:




Raiding



Dispensing



Building




Activities that will be aborted:




Relocating Cydroids (Outbound)



Relocating Cydroids (Inbound)




Consequently, any E-ther remaining in the Cydroids storage bay due to partially (in-progress at the time of listing) or not yet dispensed will belong to the new owner. Cydroids that have not completed their relocation will have their chartered course aborted and will return back to the property they are actively tethered with in preparation to serve their new owner, this applies to both inbound and outbound relocation routes.



We realise that some Players may look at this protocol as an indirect way to trade Essence, but we remind Players that Essence does not yet have a determined price on an external trading platform. Therefore, we highly recommend that both sellers and buyers take this into consideration before attempting to form any kind of deal which includes properties bundled with Essence in Cydroid Power Cells with other Players.



Earth 2 has plans to add confirmation of these specific details to the properties listed on the Marketplace in the not-so-distant future. This update will serve as an early Cydroid trading solution, predominantly for Players wishing to trade their Cydroids before the official Cydroid trading platform is released at a later date. Until such time, we discourage any blind trading of Raiding launch pads properties or attempted Essence &#8220;trading&#8221; and therefore will not be displaying Cydroids, their power status or other additional details about their digital assets on Marketplace listed properties just yet.&nbsp;



For now, please disregard advertisements or claims made by other Players regarding what Cydroids or raiding value their &#8220;for sale&#8221; property may have. Players purchasing properties from the Marketplace will not yet have any official way to confirm the included assets of the sale and therefore should conduct purchases solely based on the property details they can see.







Details on Cydroid Rarities







For a not yet confirmed period, Raiding Version 1 will provide Players with an early-access opportunity to build and obtain Cydroids directly from their Mentars via control on the Raiding panel before there is a requirement to adhere to future rules of the EcoSim.&nbsp; Only once a build is completed will Players learn which one of over 30 unique types of Cydroids they have received.&nbsp;



Each type of Cydroid will be grouped into its own distinct level of rarity, ranging between Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic and Legendary.&nbsp; Some examples are depicted in the accompanying announcement image. As part of a true continuation of core Earth 2 ideology, in the future, Players will be able to sell their Cydroids to other Players, though with the future external trading price of Essence and the trading price of Cydroids yet to be determined, Players should consider their options carefully.&nbsp; These version 1 Cydroids do present a unique opportunity, as they have the ability to directly recoup the cost of Essence used for production by raiding and collecting unstable E-ther.



The probability of generating Cydroids from the varying rarity levels is specifically tailored for this early-access feature as a special privilege to active Players on our platform. It is important to note that obtaining these diverse Cydroid types and rarity levels will be possible through alternative means in the future as part of the EcoSim, such as capturing a Cydroid&#8217;s Metasprite and refining their physical form during the materialization process.&nbsp; Having said this, the rarer the Cydroid the more difficult it will be for Players to obtain and build as a byproduct from participation in the EcoSim.&nbsp;



For now, all Cydroids will start with the same ability to carry out Raids, however, we’d like to emphasise that just as the Cydroids differ in appearance, they will also have varying special abilities in the future that have not yet been disclosed. 







Other Notes







Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to remind Players that while Raiding is the current focus point due to it being the next scheduled feature release, it only represents part of the future Earth 2 Metaverse Platform.&nbsp; That being said, Raiding is a very important step which will lead to running the global logistics system of the EcoSim, the core game mechanics engine for moving Resources, Civilians, goods, trading, building, combating, and numerous other strategic initiatives.



A reminder that we will not be releasing an official announcement the moment Raiding is live in our production environment.&nbsp; It is a considerable software release and therefore the official announcement will be made once our development team is happy that the update looks stable.



Thank you for reading this update, we look forward to seeing how Raiding is received by our wider community very soon!&nbsp;

Article 49
Title: Raiding is Officially Live on Earth 2!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/03/16/raiding-v1/

====================================================================================================
16 March, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Last week Earth 2 quietly deployed Raiding Version 1 to our production website, the first iteration of the Raiding Game Engine.&nbsp; It is important to point out that the primary purpose of developing the Raiding Game Engine was to test it in a live environment as a predecessor to the massive, upcoming EcoSim Game Engine which will track millions of objects, tasks and activities, in real time, as Players gather, process, craft, move, trade and build all over the world and on a much larger scale.



Though the primary purpose was to test our new game engine, one of the secondary purposes was to give Earth 2 Players something else to do, and even in the absence of an official announcement, many active Players still happily picked up on the covert release.  As a result, we have already experienced a significantly high volume of activity from the new feature along with an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from the community!



WHAT IS RAIDING VERSION 1?



Raiding Version 1 allows Players to build Cydroids on any properties with 4 tiles or more and a Mentar, using Essence.&nbsp; Once built, the Cydroid&#8217;s primary utility is the ability to Raid other Player-owned properties for unstable E-ther and, if detected during the scan, to collect it and bring it back to the Mentar it is tethered to.&nbsp; Cydroids can also relocate between friendly properties, store the E-ther they collect, dispense that E-ther, as well as be Powered, recharged or De-Powered. They even come in over 30 different types, of varying rarities.&nbsp;



The core design of Raiding Version 1 makes it something that can be played casually so it is simple to play but difficult to master.&nbsp; It also has the clear potential to increasingly reward Players who choose to spend more time and discover more strategies pertinent to mastering the Raiding system.&nbsp;



With relatively little effort, some early Players have already doubled or tripled their daily E-ther, meaning strategically placed properties have the ability to not only generate E-ther using traditional Mentar detection methods, but Raid additional E-ther for a healthier-than-ever E-ther intake.



Whilst the official Raiding announcement was not released until today, by Friday last week over 1 MILLION Cydroids had already been built by Players, and over 280,000 of those Cydroids were built in the first 24 hours alone!&nbsp;&nbsp;



Many Earth 2 Players have already sent their Cydroids on scores of raids, testing out raid strategies that they had been planning for months in advance based on details released by Earth 2 in the form of articles and videos.&nbsp; Some of these strategies have been discussed publicly within our community and shared with others, whilst others are being kept close to their chests.&nbsp;



If you&#8217;re looking for a quick way to get started with Raiding, jump to our videos for How to Raid and How to build a Cydroid. Otherwise, continue reading to refresh your memory on what Raiding Version 1 is all about, including some hints and tips for our early Players!



While one team of developers have been building the Raiding Game Engine, some developers from our Phase 3 team have been simultaneously focusing on representing and visualising Cydroids Raiding inside E2V1.  Here&#8217;s a little sneak peek for anyone interested!









A QUICK SUMMARY OF RAIDING RULES



Whether you are a new Player wanting to know what Raiding is, or an active Player wanting to learn more, the following information will give you some much needed insight:





E-ther is stable in the first 24 hours of its 48hr+ stability cycle. Stable E-ther cannot be raided by other Players, only the property owner can collect this E-ther.


E-ther becomes unstable after the first 24 hours of its spawning cycle. Once unstable, this E-ther can&nbsp;be raided by other Players using Cydroids.


Stable/Unstable periods are based on when the E-ther generated or spawned on each individual property, not from when it was last claimed.


The property owner can still claim their E-ther while it is unstable so long as another Player has not yet Raided it or the full cycle is complete and the E-ther disappears.


A property must have a Mentar in order to build and tether with Cydroids.


A Cydroid takes 24 hours to build (this time can be reduced by slotting an Orange jewel into your property&#8217;s Mentar).PROMOTION: &nbsp;Cydroids can be built simultaneously for a limited time only. When this promotion ends, Cydroids will revert back to Mentars only being able to build 1 Cydroid at a time.


You cannot destroy built Cydroids to recoup the Essence build cost, so build your Cydroids strategically if you plan to Raid with them and not simply keep them for other future utility.


The 5 Essence used to POWER up Cydroids can be recouped by DE-POWERING them. De-Powering can only take place when the Cydroid is 100% charged.&nbsp; Recharging Cydroids is free.


Cydroid E-ther storage, speed, and power cell efficiency can be improved using jewel boosts. Coming in the near future with the Cydroid Management feature. 


Cydroid task automation and management can be unlocked by synthesising Civilians on your property. Civilians are also planned for release in the near future. 





RAID MECHANICS: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



Q: Why is my Cydroid stuck on a raid with the scanning time as ??:??:?? ?



A: During a raid Cydroids may come across a Mentar that only contains stable E-ther. In this case the Cydroid will wait on the Property until it becomes unstable and raidable. If, however, the owner collects the E-ther before it becomes unstable, the Cydroid/s will immediately return to your property, and the raid will have been unsuccessful.When this happens, it means your Cydroid is putting in an extra effort to make sure it has a chance of being ready to collect any E-ther the moment it becomes unstable.&nbsp; This gives Players the biggest chance to catch even the active Players napping, who may be only a few minutes late in collecting their E-ther for that day.



Q: How do I know what rarity my Cydroid is?



A: All 30+ First Edition Cydroids have their own rarity which is shown by a coloured circle around the Cydroid:







White: Common



Green: Uncommon



Blue: Rare



Purple: Epic



Yellow: Legendary



For now, each Cydroid will share the distinct ability to raid unstable E-ther. However, over time, new individual skills and abilities will be discoverable or revealed as the EcoSim expands.&nbsp; The higher rarity will most likely mean the more special the Cydroid&#8217;s abilities are, which could also mean it will be more difficult to build via the EcoSim later.



Ultimately, each Cydroid will have both immediate utility and future utility which is very exciting.



Q: What is the difference between Charging and Powering?&nbsp;



A: To put it simply, Powering a Cydroid is the act of inserting an Essence Power Cell into your Cydroid. Charging a Cydroid is required when the power in the Cydroid&#8217;s Power Cell has been depleted.&nbsp;



When a Cydroid is De-Powered, it has no Power Cell and cannot function. When a Cydroid has 0% charge, it simply needs to be recharged (for free!) to be functional. You can charge the Cydroid in the Raid Menu by clicking the Property&#8217;s Yellow Icon leading to the Property Stats.&nbsp;



Q: What is the yellow screen icon for? 



A: This icon is a quick access to your Property&#8217;s Cydroid overview, where you can see which Cydroids are Idle, Relocating, Raiding, Full of E-ther, or Dispensing. You can access this view just by deselecting any of the BUILD, RELOCATE, POWER, and RAID buttons too.&nbsp;



Q: I want to see more details about my Cydroids, where can I find this info?&nbsp;&nbsp;



A: Cydroid Management will be part of a future release and this is where you will be able to see more specific details about the Cydroids you own, including a more holistic view with additional ways to manage them.&nbsp;



Keep in mind that Cydroid Management will also give you the opportunity to gain more insight into your raids and the ability to slot your Cydroids with Jewels.



RECENT UPDATES TO RAIDING:



We have been meticulously recording all of your bug reports and suggestions and the following updates which will further improve your experience are now live!&nbsp;



1. Properties will not auto-zoom focus on map on selection now.&nbsp;





Auto zoom was a cool feature to visualise on the map but it chewed up a lot of juice on the client side device so was removed to improve the overall gameplay experience.





2. Target properties can now be filtered by tile size!





A super useful addition that will reduce time searching for the perfect properties to raid.&nbsp;





3. Target icons to allow manual auto-zoom for those who wish to visualise where the property is.





While we removed the auto-zoom, there are still target icons in relevant places for when Players wish to visualise their property or target property during Raiding.





We hope you have all been enjoying Raiding so far, and if you haven&#8217;t raided anyone yet, what are you waiting for?? Try it today and let us know what you think!

====================================================================================================
March 29, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to announce a few handy updates and improvements to the Raiding system which should enhance the Raiding experience for many Players.&nbsp; Such updates need to be balanced carefully in order to comply with the long-term mechanics of the EcoSim, a system where Players will be able to use Civilians or set up P2P Contracts in order to streamline productivity and efficiency across various activities on their properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



These small but important updates demonstrate our commitment to improving key systems while in parallel multiple teams work simultaneously on other upcoming features of Earth 2.&nbsp;



As of today, the following updates have been made to the Raid menu and subpages:




Fixed an issue with the selected Raid target property focused on the map being deselected on the map when navigating between the overall &#8216;Target Properties&#8217; list and the Favourites/&#8217;Recents&#8217; lists.





Players are now able to navigate different target property lists without losing their original target selection/focus in map view.









Added the Player profile link to the Successful Raid notification





Players are now able to instantly visit the profile page of the Player they successfully raided. This will make it easier for the Player to analyse other properties owned by that Player.&nbsp;








Changed the default Sort By option selected for the &#8216;Target Properties&#8217; list from Distance (closest &#8211; furthest) to Property Size (High to Low)





Players are now able to immediately see the largest properties to raid first.








Updated the raiding flow so that Players no longer need to click through the Confirm Raid pop-up when launching a Raid





Players are now able to launch an instant raid and skip the confirmation step








Updated the &#8216;Target Properties&#8217; search input field within the RAID action to also display results for Players’ names when the Sort By: ‘Owner’&nbsp;option is selected.&nbsp;





Players are now able to easily search for a Player they wish to check is within striking distance from their property and target anything within raiding range.








Improved the &#8216;Recents&#8217; list of &#8216;Target Properties&#8217; so that recently raided properties are shown chronologically, with most recent targets appearing first in the list.





Players are now able to quickly check their &#8216;Recents&#8217; list and identify which properties they have just raided and importantly identify whether that last raid was successful or not.&nbsp;








Improved the Raid Menu ‘Sort By:’ options so that Cydroids already Dispensing are excluded from the results when the ‘Sort By:’ ‘Ready to Dispense’ option is selected.





Players are now able to separate Properties which have Cydroids that have E-ther waiting to dispense, from the properties where Cydroids with E-ther are already being dispensed.










8. Updated the Raiding flow so that when the Raid action is selected, all Cydroids available for Raiding are pre-selected.








Players are now able to Raid quickly from more properties, particularly for Players with a large portfolio of properties who will be thankful that a simple &#8211; yet time consuming &#8211; step is now auto-completed. Players who wish to send single or specific Cydroids are still able to do so.







We are listening to community feedback and taking this feedback into consideration whenever possible.  We&#8217;re also committed to improving our systems over time and thank our Players for the patience, support and feedback&nbsp;they provide as we continue on with our journey.

Title: Introducing ‘Red Energy’ &amp; the First RBA Reward
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/04/01/red-energy/

====================================================================================================
March 31, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Red Energy is now live on the Earth 2 platform and will be used to welcome the very first ‘time limited’ reward of our RBA initiative. Red Energy is the first of multiple Energy types that will be introduced into the Earth 2 platform as Player participation or achievement rewards.



What is Red Energy?



Red Energy is an energised, gas-like matter which is drawn to areas of conflict inside Earth 2. It senses conflict and almost always attaches itself to the victor or the victor’s spoils, though it has also been known to attach itself to other entities participating in or close to the conflict. Whether its attachment is formed with a single victor, or distributed within a special group of participants, there is no set pattern to this logic. Even so, Players know that it is something good to collect whenever the opportunity arises because of the various uses it will have over time.



How do I get Red Energy?



Red Energy will mostly be obtainable through activities that contain some form of conflict inside Earth 2, meaning for the most part, Players do not have to do anything additional or special outside of the activity they had already chosen to participate in. Red Energy obtained in this way can then be used for various rewards or benefits that will become available from time to time.



RBA: Rewards, Badges and Achievements



Earth 2 will always strive for active gameplay to be a source of rewards for its Players and this is one step further on delivering that promise. The specific example of Red Energy demonstrates how Players were already actively raiding for E-ther, but will now receive the surprise bonus of Red Energy and reap even more benefits from each and every successful Raid.



Our virtual world will see a plethora of various RBAs become available throughout its history. Some may be temporary and others permanent. Some will be in the form of collectible rewards, others will unlock secrets or grant special benefits. Some benefits may be active only when certain criteria are met; other benefits will be a permanent addition when an achievement is unlocked. Some rewards and benefits may be limited to the first Players to unlock a particular achievement, though most achievement-based rewards will be available for everyone to obtain. Some achievement-based rewards may also lose their beneficial power as more players unlock the same achievement.



The RBA tech tree has many branches and permeates through all areas of Earth 2. Most branches in the RBA tech tree will be hidden and only revealed for the player when a new achievement is unlocked. On occasion, Players may have to think twice before sharing their discoveries and accomplishments with others, as these benefits may be diluted as more Players accomplish those special achievements. Badges and Rewards will act differently and be explained more in the future, but Red Energy is the introduction to this larger, fluctuating RBA system.



What can Red Energy be used for?



Red Energy will have a variety of future uses in Earth 2 but initially, and for a limited time, Red Energy will allow Players to use it to energise new land purchased into a Tier 1 property. At the moment, Red Energy is particularly drawn to the E-ther pillaged from other Players&#8217; properties. Because of this strong connection between raided E-ther and Red Energy, when this E-ther is dispensed by the Player it signifies the end to the conflict and an additional 1:1 amount of Red Energy can be earned and accumulated.



Red Energy is one of many ways Earth 2’s value-for-time ethos is incorporated within the foundations for the People’s MetaverseⓇ and we’re excited about building on this foundation into the future.



Benefits of Tier 1 Land



When Tier 1 and Tier 2 Lands were first introduced to the platform, there was a balanced shift in the value and utility of these lands. The difference between these Tiers are defined by the benefits and capacity of Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 properties.



When Earth 2 announced Tier 2 land, all new land tile prices were reset to just E$0.10 per tile, lowering the barrier of entry for new Players. Now with the introduction of Red Energy to the platform, Raiders will be able to purchase Tier 1 land directly from the map for a limited time.



Tier 2 land will still be able to build Cydroids and be a launchpad for Raids, but in some cases, Players purchasing new properties to act as Raiding launch pads in new areas may wish to enjoy the spoils of their Raiding efforts by using their Red Energy to make their new property Tier 1.



Additionally, and depending on the location, Tier 1 tiles may even be cheaper than the current price of new Tier 2 land in some countries making it a great reward for Players successfully Raiding.



After all, it’s always handy to have a little more Essence generation :




Power will be integral inside Earth 2 and running cities require a lot of Essence;



Essence is also used to obtain various “Ethereal” items that become available, such as Cydroids, some buildings, and blueprints for physical buildings;



Essence could also be used in various ways for premium boosts, like overclocking machines &#8211; or the weaver &#8211; for boost benefitsEssence can be staked for things like Power Cells, earning more for the staker;



Essence will be lendable to other Players on fixed contracts;



And these are just some of the utilities that already exist or are upcoming, with so much more yet to come!




How do I buy Tier 1 land?



Every time you successfully Raid and dispense E-ther, the attached Red Energy will be credited to you, the Raider, and automatically accumulate in your balance.







To buy Tier 1 land from the map, simply select up to 750 tiles in a country of your choice. Select BUY NOW which will then display a checkbox to unlock your selected tiles to be Tier 1, using your Red Energy.






You will need 3 units of Red Energy for every tile selected for purchase. If your Red Energy balance is insufficient, you can earn more by successfully raiding and dispensing more E-ther.



How can I check my Red Energy balance?



Checking your Red Energy balance is very simple. You can find the current balance on:




Your profile page;









Your Transactions History (Selct Other Transaction Type);








The Buy Land checkout page











To summarise all the new information on Red Energy:




Successfully Raided E-ther dispensed by the Player will reward a 1:1 amount of Red Energy



For a limited time, Red Energy will allow Players to energise new land purchased into a Tier 1 property.



You will need 3 units of Red Energy for every Tier 1 tile selected for purchase.



Red Energy is the first of multiple Energy types in Earth 2



Red Energy is an energised, gas-like matter drawn to areas of conflict inside Earth 2



Red Energy will be obtainable through activities and can then be used for various rewards or benefits that will become available from time to time



Active gameplay is a source of rewards for its Players. Players already actively raiding for E-ther will now receive the surprise bonus of Red Energy



A plethora of various RBAs will become available in Earth 2. 



Tier 1 tiles may even be cheaper than the current price of new Tier 2 land in some countries, making it a great reward for Players successfully Raiding.

Title: E2PRV System Reopens for Silver and Copper Resource Claims
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/04/14/e2prv-silver-copper/

====================================================================================================
April 14, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; The Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) system is an initiative primarily designed and developed to provide our Players with the opportunity to claim a Resource they could prove exists on the correlating real world location and, therefore, should also exist on their land inside Earth 2.&nbsp; The secondary purpose of the E2PRV system is to facilitate community collaboration and enable other Players to support these claims in return for a reward if the claim proved to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We approached this validation process very seriously and formed a stand alone internal team, we refer to as the CAT, whose sole focus is to review Player submitted claims and either approve or reject those claims based on an internal assessment criteria.&nbsp; Though the CAT has erred on the side of leniency, we have always been clear that the CAT reserves the right on final decision to award or reject a Resource validation claim.



We’re proud to say that the CAT has almost completed the rigorous validation process for over 75,000 claims!&nbsp; These covered a variety of claims submitted for Coal, Limestone, Iron Ore, Gold, and Oil Resources. Overall, we deem the E2PRV initiative, which was originally designed to benefit our Players, as&nbsp; a massive success, with tens of thousands of Players benefitting not only from the distribution of the claimed Resource on their land, without cost,&nbsp; but from the generous Essence reward associated with the claim approval.&nbsp;



Now that we are drawing close to completion on the initial E2PRV claims, we want to keep the CAT moving, so we are excited to have reopened our E2PRV system for Silver and Copper claims, with a few adjustments to the system which will be covered in this article.&nbsp;



E2PRV Reopens With A Few Adjustments!



Though we have developed and supported the ability for Players to claim Resources on their Earth 2 land, based on Resources that exist in real world locations, we have always planned to procedurally spawn Resources in areas that may not correlate to real world locations, as a way to make things interesting.



Earth 2 invested a significant amount of development time, funds and effort into sourcing, purchasing rights to, and processing massive amounts of global data based on real world Resource locations in order to ensure Players automatically received Gold, Oil, Iron, Limestone and Coal on their properties. 



But moving forward, as we commit more development time and resources toward the initial release of E2V1 and other upcoming features, we now plan to focus on the procedural placement of future tiered Resources, something that was strongly suggested by supporters and critics alike, without automated real-world placement.  This decision will save significant development time, funds and resources which can be better directed toward other developments.



Pursuing the procedural placement of future Resource types will also bring with it the exciting opportunity for Players to discover Resource locations in new ways such as through exploration and scanning inside E2V1. Imagine finding that perfect vein of rutile with a nice consistency of titanium!&nbsp;&nbsp;



Although we will be pursuing a more procedural distribution of Resources inside E2V1, we still want to provide a window of opportunity for Players to claim some of these future Resources, if they are able to provide proof their property contains that Resource in the real world.&nbsp; These windows of opportunity will not be tied to a specific duration, but will tend to last around 4-8 weeks. Therefore, if you’re planning on claiming a future Resource for one of your properties, be sure to keep a close eye on Earth 2 announcements.&nbsp;&nbsp;



For now, the re-opening of the E2PRV system for Copper and Silver Resource claims on Player-owned properties offers a fantastic opportunity for Players who believe they have Copper or Silver on their property, to create a claim and potentially get the presence of that Resource validated.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Additionally, now more Players than ever may have a little more&nbsp; dispensable Essence to stake on E2PRV claims, capitalising on their gains from Raiding or the initial E2PRV initiative.&nbsp; But remember, rejections are always possible so be mindful of what you stake your Essence on!&nbsp; Players should take a good note of the following information and adjustments pertaining to the E2PRV system:




The E2PRV system has reopened for silver and copper claims only.&nbsp;



A reduced Assurance Fee of E$2.50 will apply per claim submitted. This fee will be returned to the Player only if the claim is approved or reimbursed.



No Assurance Fee will be applied to a Player’s claims after their 100th active claim.&nbsp;



Only 1 Resource can be claimed per property per claim. I.e. If you are claiming both silver and copper for 1 property, you must submit 2 individual claims.&nbsp;



Stakeable Essence proportionately depends on the tile size of the claim property, as before.&nbsp;



6.5% is the new staking reward for an approved claim.&nbsp;



The minimum Essence stake is 0.1&nbsp;



The Essence staking will be adjustable by increments of 0.1 . I.e. You cannot stake 0.15 Essence.



Evidence that is considered valid will have factual, scientifically accurate information that exactly corresponds to the property location. FOR EXAMPLE: If your property is 5 kms away from a mine, you must provide evidence of the radius of the mine being 5 kms and your property falling under that radius. 



A claim that is approved will receive the original Essence staked, an additional 6.5% Essence bonus, the refunded Assurance Fee, and the Resource distributed on the property.&nbsp;



A claim that is rejected will receive none of the above. Neither staked Essence nor the Claim Assurance Fees shall be refunded for rejected claims. 



A new timing system has been implemented which provides stakers with a short window to review the claim before staking.&nbsp; This will start at a 60 second cooldown period per claim in order to give rogue stakers a little time to take a high-level glance at the claim but also not discourage collaborative claims.



The Player creating the claim can stake on their own claim either at claim creation or during the 60 second cool down window if they miss staking during the claim creation, so the creator of the claim always has the first opportunity to stake their own claim.




What about Current E2PRV Claims?



While most existing claims have now been evaluated and assigned an outcome, there are still some claims marked for approval and pending Resource distribution, so don’t worry if your claim remains ‘Under Investigation’ as it may still be approved over the coming days.&nbsp;



Note on Resource Frequency Changes: Due to the auto-approval process for claims which fall in the designated area of a valid claim, some properties may have the attributed Resource frequency changed after “approval”. This change can happen all the way up until the final claim is validated. However, if a change in frequency occurs, it will always be an improvement (e.g. frequency changes will only ever be from UF to HF, not HF to UF).&nbsp;



Claim Rejections



In addition to the backlog of claims waiting for approval, all claims that were determined as invalid will be rejected once all pending approvals are finalised. As previously stated, claim rejection will occur once all other claims have been approved so as to allow claims that provided invalid evidence to still be approved, and rewarded, under a valid polygon.&nbsp;



As these rejections will be done in a single action, we understand it may be disheartening for some Players to see a large number of rejections coming through.&nbsp; In most cases, claims flagged for rejection simply did not provide valid evidence to support their claim, and did not follow the distinct guidelines we publicised from the very beginning.&nbsp;



For example, many claims simply provided evidence of gold broadly existing in Australia, in general, for a property located in Australia. This type of claim and evidence could not be deemed as sufficient, nor accurate to the exact location of their property, and therefore must be rejected. We fully understand the time and Essence that many of our Players have put into the E2PRV process and that is why our team have erred on the side of leniency in terms of validating these claims, whilst maintaining the integrity of the process.&nbsp;



Ultimately, this delayed the entire validation process as the CAT performed additional research for every single ‘invalid’ claim, to verify whether there was in fact the occurrence of the Resource in the area.&nbsp; This additional work was carried out despite the Player not having submitted any location-based evidence. While this was very time-costly to our team and resources, it was an additional step we decided to take, to benefit as many Players as possible.&nbsp;



That being said, there are still a significant number of claims which we fundamentally could not approve, and these are the claims you will be seeing come through in the bulk rejections.&nbsp;



UAE Oil Claims



UAE Oil claims are slowly but surely getting approved by the massive Resource polygon we have attributed to this area. These approvals and Oil distribution within the UAE will be complete before the final rejections occur.&nbsp;



Closing Notes



As always, Players are urged to exercise due diligence when gathering evidence for their silver and copper claims. Whilst we strongly encourage Players to work together and share information, evidence that works for one Player will not necessarily work for another Player. Due to some claims being auto-approved under a Resource polygon, evidence that was provided for an auto-approved claim is not guaranteed to result in another approval (as the evidence may have been insufficient but the claim was lucky enough to fall under a verified polygon).&nbsp;



The E2PRV system was created to empower our Players by providing them with an opportunity to take ownership and claim Resources they believe should be present on their property. This opportunity will not last for long as we gradually move towards distributing Resources which may not correspond with their real-world locations but contribute to the overall balance of the EcoSim. Once this opportunity is missed, a Player will no longer be permitted to claim a Resource based on real world data, and unless a new claim period is reopened for that particular Resource, all Players will need to rely on the Earth 2 Resource distribution balancing mechanic for Resources on their existing properties.&nbsp;



We are building an incredible Resource system that will become the underlying foundation of everything buildable inside Earth 2. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for an upcoming announcement about Wood, Water and Sand and scores of other Resource types set to play key parts in the Earth 2 EcoSim!

Title: E-ther transactions brings E-ther Banking one step closer &amp; more
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/04/20/ether-update/

====================================================================================================




April 20, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 has implemented important changes which will allow Players to see itemised transaction records for E-ther gained inside the Earth 2 EcoSim. These updates have been made in preparation for the increasing utility that E-ther will have inside of Earth 2, such as for the upcoming Civilians release, the future E-ther banking system, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



This E-ther update will have minimal effects on the Player experience and for the most part, Players will still receive their E-ther-awaiting-claim notifications as per usual, and claim said E-ther as per usual.&nbsp;



Changes to claimed E-ther storage (and transactions)



In order to prepare the E-ther mechanics to work correctly for Civilian Synthesis and other future utilities within the EcoSim, we have implemented a new system which moves away from storing E-ther &#8220;locally&#8221; per property (how it used to work) and tallying the total to now storing it as an aggregated &#8220;global&#8221; Player balance, making the Player&#8217;s E-ther balance accessible for future use on any of their properties, regardless of which location it originated from. This means that E-ther will still evaporate on Player-owned land but, once claimed, this E-ther will be stored as a fully fledged aggregated global balance, without being distinguished as originating from a specific property.&nbsp;



Not only was this a significant change required before the release of Civilians, but an update necessary for the future E-ther banking system which will allow Players to convert partial amounts of E-ther into Essence.



Changes to Player Experience



While this technical update required considerable reworking of our backend system, it is something that will not greatly impact a Player&#8217;s experience in how they collect and store their E-ther. As a player, the only changes you may notice will be that the EDC (only relevant to T1+EDC Land holders) value deduction occurs when E-ther is claimed, rather than when E-ther is transformed into Essence.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that E-ther is now banked as an aggregated global balance per Player and not per property.



Our previous system was purpose-built to store the E-ther claimed per property resulting in a direct link to the relevant property when Players transformed their E-ther into Essence allowing for local property EDC balances to be more easily deducted.&nbsp; Moving forward, our engineering team identified a number of drawbacks in continuing with this legacy system which resulted in a decision to&nbsp; deduct the equivalent value in Essence from the EDC on that property when the owner of that property claims the E-ther, not when the E-ther is transformed into Essence.



This update was quietly deployed around April 14th to give our developers time to ensure the new system was working correctly before making an official announcement.



Updated EDC deduction process (reduced deduction rate)&nbsp;



Essence that is deducted from a Player&#8217;s EDC total is equal to a static percentage conversion amount of E-ther, and allows a Player&#8217;s Essence gain / EDC deduction value to be accurately calculated. While the E-ther to Essence conversion rate may, in the future, change for all Land Tiles, the E-ther evaporation on original Tier 1 land with EDC will be adjusted to account for any changes implemented. Calculating the EDC deductions at the E-ther claiming stage, rather than the transformation stage (what used to happen), also means that the EDC total is now reduced in smaller increments, rather than in large amounts as was previously the case when Players would collect and save up their E-ther before transforming to Essence in bulk.&nbsp;



The EDC total will only be reduced when the evaporated E-ther is claimed by the owner of the EDC property, it will not be reduced if the E-ther dissipates or if the E-ther is raided by other Players.&nbsp;



Players still have the option to transform their E-ther directly into Essence as has always been the case, or to use boosted EDC E-ther on something else.&nbsp; The choice is completely up to the Player.&nbsp;



Updates to the E-ther transaction page



Players will also notice their claimed E-ther transactions are now listed per property they originated from.&nbsp; This will prove very handy for many Players and provide insights into how much E-ther was claimed on a Player’s property and how much was Raided and dispensed from Cydroids.







To summarise the latest update to E-ther transactions:




Claimed E-ther is now stored in a Player&#8217;s global balance, rather than per property (as it used to be)&nbsp;



Claimed E-ther values are now listed in a Player&#8217;s transactions&nbsp;



EDC deductions are made when a Player claims their E-ther from their properties, rather than when a Player transforms their E-ther into Essence.



EDC deductions made at the point of E-ther claim are now incremental and automatic, rather than relying on a Player to manually transform their E-ther into Essence. 



E-ther that is raided from properties will not reduce the Player&#8217;s EDC value. It is only when the owner Player claims their E-ther and the E-ther is added to their global balance that the EDC deductions are made.



E-ther dispensed as a result of raiding is also listed in the new E-ther transactions page




Thank you for your ongoing support and patience as we continue adjusting, improving and developing systems required for future plans inside Earth 2.&nbsp; 



Over the past month Earth 2 has released Cydroids, Raiding, multiple Raiding Improvements, Red Energy, the new E2PRV system for Silver and Copper and now E-ther Transactions. 



All of these releases have taken place as our team simultaneously closes in on the release of Civilians, continued development of E2V1, massive internal progress on EcoSim game design dynamics and many other ‘things’ constantly happening in the background!&nbsp;

Title: Get Supercharged on Earth 2 Day 2023!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/04/22/earth2day-2023/

====================================================================================================
April 22, 2023 – Sydney, Australia – Last year on April 23rd, Earth 2 introduced the #E24E1 #Earth2Day concept. Our long-term goals to provide assistance back to Earth 1, across numerous noteworthy causes including humanitarian, environmental and educational have not changed. However, we admit and take ownership that in order to help others we first need to complete building core foundational features for the EcoSim, Token Launch and E2V1.



Our commitment to building our own 1:1 scale digital replication of the planet Earth, E2V1, has also not changed, with multiple videos released displaying progressive development since #Earth2Day 2022, the most notable being the Earth 2 Version 1 3D Earth Tech Demo on YouTube in December last year. E2V1 has progressed even further since then, something we will be excited to show again closer to the Essence Token Launch.



Although we have not yet implemented systems that will directly or indirectly filter back to help our physical planet Earth, we also did not want to simply let #Earth2Day idly slip by without offering our active Players some form of a reward, at the very least remembering the #Earth2Day concept.



Therefore, from UTC 00:01 April 23, 2023 to UTC 00:01 April 24, 2023, Earth 2 will become &#8216;supercharged&#8217; as a sign of acknowledgement for #Earth2Day resulting in an increased spawn rate of E-ther by 500%!



This E-ther will spawn progressively during that period and will be subject to the standard E-ther rules, remaining stable for 24 hours once detected by the Mentar, giving the owner that period of time to claim their E-ther before it becomes unstable and Open Season begins for Earth 2 Raiders!



So be sure to log in and claim your bonus E-ther during the 24 -hour stable time before it ends up in the belly of a lurking Cydroid!

Title: Sustenance for First Edition Civilians on Earth 2
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/05/03/civilian-sustenance/

====================================================================================================
May 3, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to share details of the first sustenance system within Earth 2. Amongst other things, this article will also explain how Red Energy will be used specifically as the initial unit to sustain the First Edition Earth 2 Civilians.



First Edition Civilians will primarily be focused on helping Players to streamline and automate their Raiding operations.&nbsp; Players will be able to keep their Civilians happy, sustained, and focused on their tasks by feeding them Red Energy (a type of energy that can be gained via conflict-type activities such as executing successful raids on other Player’s properties).



“Following changes that were made to the game design team last year, we have been striving to build systems with completed game loops”, said Earth 2 Founder, Shane Isaac.&nbsp; “First Edition Civilians are part of the Raiding feature and although these various mechanics are being developed in steps, once Civilians are fully released we will see a full circle game loop, something we are dedicated to continue and replicate in other key aspects of Earth 2 moving forward.”&nbsp;



Shane went on to say, “We are also working on visually representing these game mechanics inside E2V1 in real time allowing Player initiated EcoSim type game play that immersive Players can not only see but be able to interact with in different ways while running around inside E2V1, for example, strategic Players on the EcoSim mixing their activity directives with hands on Players inside E2V1 with both being able to influence the experience of one another. We will start to see an amalgamation of different style Player activity converging into the same space, where you might have one Player executing directives for logistics from their mobile device and another trying to directly intercept that directive inside E2V1.  It&#8217;s something I am personally really excited to develop over time.”



Details on How Red Energy Sustenance Works



Red Energy is instantly transferable via a Player’s Mentar network, meaning a Player can use their global Red Energy balance to sustain their Civilians on any of their properties around the world.&nbsp; This means that Red Energy earned in Africa can be used to sustain a Player&#8217;s&nbsp;Civilians in America, and vice versa.&nbsp;



If a Player does not have enough Red Energy to sustain their First Edition Civilians, then those Civilians who miss out on Red Energy will cease working and begin wandering in the wilderness, looking for food or another source to sustain them to stay alive.&nbsp; For now, a Player will have the ability to convince their wandering Civilians to return automatically to their property and tasks once they have enough Red Energy to lure them back.



First Edition Civilians will require one Red Energy unit per week to keep them loyal and happy.&nbsp; The unit of Red Energy is automatically distributed to each Civilian, once a week based on the day they received their first sustenance of Red Energy.&nbsp; For example, if you synthesise a Civilian on a Monday, you will need to replenish that Civilian with Red Energy every Monday.&nbsp; If a Civilian that was usually replenished on a Monday wandered into the wilderness and was lured back on a Wednesday, the new weekly sustenance cycle would occur on a Wednesday.







In addition to individual property data, an overview of the Civilian workforce and Red Energy Sustenance requirements will be featured under Civilian Management. The above UI example shows that:&nbsp;




This Player has a total of 843 active Civilians



In addition to the 843 Civilians,there are 54 non-active in a &#8220;Wandering&#8221; state



The Player provided 143 Red Energy units to sustain their active Civilians today&nbsp;



The Player also provided 8 extra Red Energy units to lure back 8 wandering Civilians.

Note: Red Energy from your balance is automatically used to lure back any wandering Civilians. If there are not enough Red Energy units, as there are Civilians to sustain, as many Civilians as possible will be fed using the remaining balance. In this UI example, all wandering Civilians would have been lured back because the Player has enough Red Energy in their Balance, but we altered the figures to include some wandering Civilians, to better demonstrate how this system will work.





157 Red Energy Units will be required tomorrow to keep currently active Civilians sustained



An extra 54 Red Energy Units will be required if the Player expects to lure back all wandering Civilians, however, if the Player only had 12 excess Red Energy Units, then only 12 Civilians would be lured back, leaving 42 still wandering.



The Player will also see a forecast for Days 3 to 7 displaying how much Red Energy they are going to need to sustain their current Civilian workforce.




Later, Players may be able to intentionally let Civilians go or sell them in the Bazaar, but for now, Civilians will begin wandering automatically if they are not given their Red Energy on time.&nbsp; The time and date the Civilians require their Red Energy will determine the order in which they begin to wander.



Is E-ther still Life?



E-ther will continue to represent life and the future of sustaining Civilians inside Earth 2 will still rely on E-ther.&nbsp; When agriculture and farming are introduced, Players will require some E-ther to initiate the process. However, after initiation, the production system will become sustainable via other means, such as work force, water, machinery and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;



From time-to-time Earth 2 may design for other non-conventional methods to accommodate a particular purpose, such as the case with Red Energy, something that is already tied to E-ther and conflict.&nbsp; To avoid the need for Players to spend E-ther in order to sustain their First Edition Civilians, the introductory sustenance system was designed using Red Energy as a direct gain from successful gameplay which in turn supports growth of the Player’s Civilian workforce and rewards the Player with a way to sustain their Civilians until farming and agriculture components of the EcoSim is introduced.



Future Plans



In the future, wandering Civilians will be vulnerable to other Players luring them away, meaning a Player could lose their Civilians to another Player if they are not properly taken care of.&nbsp; Additionally, Players who lose their Civilian regularly may see their Civilian leave the property all together, to roam around inside E2V1 until either another Player convinces them to join their workforce, or something else.

Title: Civilians XP + Raid Commander Targeting System 
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/05/17/civilians-xp-target-system/

====================================================================================================
May 17, 2023 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211; Before Civilians are deployed to our Stage 2 pre-production server, we would like to provide an update to our Earth 2 Community about how the new Civilians XP and Raid Commander Auto-Target system will function.



We would also like to point out that Red Energy Sustenance, Civilians XP and the expanded Raid Commander Auto-Target system are new expansions to the original Civilians concept which subsequently caused a delay on the previously scheduled release of the initial Civilians system.&nbsp;&nbsp;



“These new systems are deep and intricate and I’d like to take a moment to thank our BE developers, FE developers, game designers, QA, UI/UX team and others who have managed to design the mechanics, design the interface, implement the backend, code and connect the frontend and run initial quality assurance checks, all in a record time considering how complicated these new additional expansions are and how they needed to be merged into the original concept”, said Shane Isaac, Founder of Earth 2.



“The newly introduced game mechanics help form a more robust game loop, reward players who progress with better skilled and better functioning Civilians, allow Raid Commanders to target multiple properties, introduce an early version of the sustenance concept which ties back to direct Player activity, provides new strategic play and very importantly it allowed us to create, design and develop systems that we can test for planned adoption in other parts of the EcoSim.”



CIVILIANS XP SYSTEM



While Civilians will help Players manage their properties and tasks inside Earth 2, improving Civilians abilities will require more than E-ther and Red Energy to synthesise and sustain them. This is where the new Civilians XP system will come in handy.



The Civilians XP system will allow Players to level up their Civilians, boosting productivity and obtaining new skills through hands-on experience.&nbsp; The first Civilians, which will assist Players to execute their Raiding activities, will gain XP from successful Raids when E-ther is dispensed on that property.&nbsp; Initially, every 0.01 E-ther dispensed will equate to 1 XP.



It takes a team effort between the Civilians to Charge, Raid and Dispense, therefore, the XP is evenly split between however many Civilians Players have dedicated to their Raiding system for each specific property. If a Player has 3 Civilians on one property and that property dispenses 3 E-ther, that would equate to 300 XP, with each Civilian receiving 100 XP.



Players will be able to check their Civilian’s XP level by following the below steps:





Go to the Civilians tab to see all Civilians 











Select a Civilian from the list to see their Civilian Info &#8211; the current XP details can be found under the Civilian image including which Level the Civilian is on currently and how much XP is required to reach the next level.











To improve Civilian XP through automated tasks, ensure the Civilian is active. Players are able to adjust the Civilian’s active tasks (depending on the Civilian) by going to the Civilian Ability tab and editing their current tasks.&nbsp;











These 2 images show the difference between a Space Force Raid Commander Civilian that is at Level 2 XP vs. level 6 XP (the current highest level).&nbsp;













It is important to note that Players can gain XP for their Civilians even when Raiding manually, effectively teaching any Civilians they have on that property by executing the task themselves. For example, if a Level 1 E-ther Reckoner is due to start dispensing in 120 minutes, Players can manually press the Dispense button earlier, speeding up the process without losing any XP points.



Here is a helpful chart outlining the various XP points required to level up, and some of the abilities associated with each XP level.







RAID COMMANDER TARGET SYSTEM



The Raid Commander has the unique ability to target properties and automatically launch raids for a Player.&nbsp; Players are able to not only select which properties to Auto Raid, but they can easily adjust which properties are targeted by adding or removing favourite icon types to the Auto Raid target icon interface.



There are 2 prerequisites before a property can be auto-targeted by the Raid Commander :&nbsp;&nbsp;





The target property MUST have been manually raided AT LEAST ONCE from the launching property and appear in the Recent List of raided properties


The target property MUST have a favourite icon assigned to it AND that favourite icon MUST be added to the Auto-Raid target icon interface





Most active Raiders have developed their own system using the existing favourite icons to determine the best to worst properties to raid from their launch properties.&nbsp; The Raid Commander&#8217;s Auto-Targeting System allows Players to then set one or more favourite icons on the new Auto-Raid targeting interface. By adding or removing Favourite Icons from this interface, Players can determine which properties their Raid Commander should focus on launching auto-raids to.&nbsp;



Each property will have its own unique Auto-Raid Target Icon interface, enabling Players to customise and set different Auto-Raid Target Icons for each property they own.&nbsp; For example, a Player may focus on raiding blue birds, green trees and red cherries from one property or just blue birds from another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



What&#8217;s more, if a Player has selected the blue bird and green tree icon with a Level 1 Raid Commander, the Raid Commander will find the most recent blue bird OR green tree icon from the recent list and continue raiding and re-raiding that property.&nbsp; If the Player has a Level 2 Raid Commander, then it will find the 2nd most recent blue bird OR green tree icon from the recent list and raid that property, meaning it will alternate between raiding two different properties as opposed to one because the 2nd most recent will keep renewing, resulting in a new property taking its position on the recent list each time an auto raid occurs.



This dynamic Targeting System will allow Players to refocus their Raid Commander on different groups of target properties quickly and effectively.&nbsp; We designed this system instead of a numerically assigned target system which would have resulted in Players needing to manually set static lists that would require granular, individual property adjustments if Raid success rates changed.



Though our unique Targeting System may take a little longer to understand, we are confident it will better streamline the Auto-Raiding function and require less granular adjustments by the Player in the long run.&nbsp;



Players will be able to set up Auto-Raiding using the Raid Commander by using the following steps:





Look for the “Auto Target Properties for Raid Commander” text and press the accompanying EDIT button.&nbsp; This will be accessible via the existing Raid interface and the new Civilian interface











When “EDIT” is selected, Players will be presented with the Auto-Raid Target Icon interface which will allow them to set the favourite icons they want their Raid Commander to Target or Ignore for the selected property











In this particular case below, the Player has selected only the green tree as the target icon.&nbsp; If the Raid Commander was a Level 1, it would repeatedly raid MindeIslands.&nbsp; A Level 2 Raid Commander would raid Suricato, then Mindelands. A Level 3 Raid Commander would raid LOVEBTS, then Suricato, and then Mindelands. In this case, the Raid Commander is a Level 6 and the AUTO RAID button displays the order of properties the Raid Commander will target.&nbsp; This AUTO RAID list is determined by the target icons the Player has chosen so a Player can always visualise the results of their target icon selections.









Note that in order for a Raid Commander to auto-raid a target property, that property must have already been raided at least once manually, have a favourite icon applied, and the favourite icon must be set as a targeted icon.&nbsp;



SYNTHESISING CIVILIANS



To begin, Players will be able to synthesise 3 Civilians on properties of 4 tiles or larger.&nbsp; Each Civilian will require 25 E-ther and 4 Red Energy Units to be fully synthesised.&nbsp; Each Civilian will require an ongoing 4 Red Energy Units per week to sustain them, an increase from 1 Red Energy Unit as previously stated.



Only one Civilian can be synthesised at a time, the first Civilian being the E-ther Reckoner (Dispenser), the second the Cydroid Technician (Recharger) and the third Civilian that can be synthesised is the Raid Commander.&nbsp; The E-ther Reckoner will also have the ability to choose between automatically dispensing any E-ther stored as soon as it returns back from a Raid or to wait until the Storage is full before dispensing.&nbsp; &nbsp;It can also abort a Cydroid dispensing from Level 5 in case that Cydroid is potentially needed in sudden scenarios that could occur in the future.



To Synthesise a Civilian:





Go to Civilian Management and select the Properties tab. 











Select the property and then initiate synthesis. Player may select 1-3 Civilians for synthesis per property, initially.&nbsp;











Civilians may be synthesised one at a time or if a Player is sure they want to synthesise all three, three can be scheduled for synthesisation which will automatically cause the next Civilian to start synthesising once its predecessor has finished.&nbsp; The Civilians that are synthesised unlock a set order of abilities. Therefore, if Players need a Raid Commander on their property, they will need to synthesise the first 2 Civilians first.&nbsp;









We are excited for Players to explore the new Civilians feature on our Stage2 pre-production server in the near future. Keep an eye on our socials for upcoming announcements on the official release of Civilians, but as has historically been the case, we plan to release Civilians on the live server and ensure everything is stable before releasing the official announcement.

Article 57
Title: First Edition Civilians Officially Live on Earth 2!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/06/09/civilians-live/

====================================================================================================
June 9, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Our highly anticipated First Edition Civilians are now live on Earth 2! Synthesise Civilians on your properties to manage your Cydroids and Raids, and level up to improve your Civilians performance by gaining XP! 



Since the release of the Raiding system, Players have been eagerly awaiting the release of the Civilians system. These First Edition Civilians will be tasked with Raid-focused jobs, but in the future, they may have a part to play in other areas of Earth 2. 



The Civilian system was primarily designed and developed for the purpose of assisting Players to manage their properties, and this is something that Players will experience in a wide array, as further iterations of Civilians are released. 



This initial release of the Civilian system is more robust than our original scope details published late last year and includes key improvements such as the ability to raid multiple properties with the Raid Commander, a targeting system, an XP system and a sustenance system, all of which were complicated additions yet critical in improving the overall Player experience with Civilians and rewarding those who spend the time to learn and grind.



Recap: What are Civilians?



Civilians are semi-sentient beings synthesised by Players and employed to automate the operation of various Raiding tasks, removing the need for the Player to carry out each task manually. Civilians are essential for Players with a large portfolio of properties to manage all their tasks efficiently. However, Civilians may also be used by Players who are wanting to reduce their manual task-load in general.&nbsp;



Interested in the lore behind Civilians? Check out our deep-dive video here, but remember, the Civilian Game Mechanics developed were a more advanced version that what is covered in this video:









Civilian Management Interface



Civilians can be synthesised and managed via the Civilian Management interface, which is located within the Raid Management page.  This can be accessed by either the Drop Down Menu or via the Raid Interface. 







The Civilian Management Interface will display the Player’s Red Energy Overview, as well as the option to manage by Civilians, or by Properties.&nbsp;







Players must select a property to synthesise a Civilian. If your property is not displayed in the list of properties, it is most likely because the property consists of less than 4 tiles.&nbsp;







How can I synthesise a Civilian?&nbsp;



For Earth 2’s First Edition Civilians, a Player must have a property consisting of a minimum of 4 tiles to synthesise and support a Civilian. Why 4 tiles? Well one reason for this is that Red Energy is required to sustain Civilians, and Civilians on less than 4 tile properties will not be contributing to any E-ther or Red Energy gains, since raiding is not supported on these properties.&nbsp; The only way to obtain Red Energy currently is to successfully Raid E-ther from enemy properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;



First Edition Civilians are synthesised in the Synthesis Chamber within the Mentar using E-ther and Red Energy. However, these Civilians are prone to wandering in search of sustenance and later on, Players may be able to obtain new Civilians by enticing a wandering Civilian who has strayed from their property.&nbsp;



For now, the cost to Synthesise and sustain a single Civilian is as follows:



Synthesis Cost: 25 E-ther + 4 Red Energy Units



Civilian Sustenance: 4 Red Energy Units per week



Synthesis Time: 24 hours per Civilians (only 1 Civilian can be synthesised at a time in a Mentar).



Order of Synthesis



One property can currently support up to 3 Civilians and only one Civilian is synthesised at a time.&nbsp; Civilians are always synthesised in the same order:




The E-ther Reckoner: Automatically dispenses E-ther gained from Raids



The Cydroid Technician: Automatically recharges depleted Cydroids



The Raid Commander: Automatically sends Cydroids on Raids to selected properties (see the auto-raid How-To below)




To synthesise a Raid Commander on a property, the E-ther Reckoner and Cydroid Technician Civilians must be synthesised first.







Synthesised Civilians will appear as so:







Sustenance for Civilians



Once synthesised, a Civilian must be fed Red Energy regularly to keep them from abandoning their tasks and wandering away from their property. Sustaining one Civilian requires 4 Red Energy units per week, even if they haven’t been actively working or if they are turned off from their tasks. The Red Energy required to sustain your Civilians will be automatically deducted from your total Red Energy Balance. 







If you do not have enough Red Energy, your Civilians will start wandering. If you gain more Red Energy through successfully dispensing raided E-ther, they will automatically return back to their properties.



Civilian XP and Occupational Mastery Levels



Newly synthesised Civilians will begin at Occupational Mastery Level 1 with 0 Experience Points (XP).&nbsp; Civilians gain XP every time E-ther is successfully raided and dispensed on their property. This includes E-ther gained through manual raids. For every 1 E-ther dispensed, 100 XP is distributed amongst all the Civilians on the property (if there is only 1 Civilian on the property, that Civilian will gain 100XP, if there are 2 Civilians each one will gain 50 XP, and so on).&nbsp;



The XP Level, also known as an Occupational Mastery Level, determines how skillful a Civilian is at their job. Every time a Civilian reaches a higher Level, they will unlock more abilities/benefits which will directly improve their efficiency and speed, for now, up to Level 6 at which time they will stop gaining XP until more levels are released.



Once you have synthesised Civilians on your property, you should be able to see a countdown in the Raid interface property card, under one or more of the action buttons: Charge, Dispense and/or Raid.



If no countdown is shown, this can be due to a number of reasons:




The Civilians have gone wandering off! Replenish your Red Energy to lure them back.



The Cydroids are already working! When the Cydroids return to Idle, a new countdown will start for the next action.&nbsp;








Each Civilian will have different wait times for completing their automated tasks, based on their Occupational Mastery Level. This wait time is displayed for each property with Civilians under the respective buttons for the automated task: RAID, CHARGE ALL, and DISPENSE ALL.



A Player can choose to bypass the wait time by manually selecting the button at any time.&nbsp;



The First Civilian: E-ther Reckoner



The E-ther Reckoner automatically dispenses E-ther raided by the Cydroids on the property. You can set your E-ther Reckoner to dispense E-ther when the Cydroid’s E-ther storage is either “Full” or “Contains E-ther”.&nbsp;



If you raid a lot of small properties with little E-ther, it could be more efficient to dispense when the Cydroids are full. However, if you expect your Cydroids to return with large amounts of E-ther, it&#8217;s probably more efficient to dispense as soon as they contain any E-ther so they can collect as much E-ther as possible on the next raid.&nbsp;







Auto-Dispensing Ability:



The E-ther Reckoner’s XP Level will determine how much wait tme there is before your Civilian automatically dispenses E-ther from the Cydroid/s.&nbsp;







Level 1: 120 minute wait before dispensing



Level 2: 90 minute wait before dispensing



Level 3: 60 minute wait before dispensing



Level 4: 30 minute wait before dispensing



Level 5: 15 minute wait before dispensing + Unlocks the ability to abort the dispensing process early.&nbsp;



Level 6: 5 minute wait before dispensing + Ability to abort the dispensing process early.&nbsp;



In addition to the waiting period, dispensing will only be initiated when the Cydroid is at 100% charge and the Cydroid is Idle.



Abort Dispense



Level 5 and 6 E-ther Reckoners have the ability to abort the dispense action.&nbsp;







If you decide to abort dispensing during an automated process, your E-ther Reckoner’s auto-dispense settings and the Cydroid’s E-ther storage status will affect what action is triggered. If you have set your E-ther Reckoner to dispense Cydroids when they “Contain E-ther”, the abort action will reset the E-ther Reckoner’s countdown for auto-dispense, at which time the dispensing process will restart. If you have set your E-ther Reckoner to only dispense Cydroids when they are “Full” and the Cydroid is partially dispensed when the abort action is initiated, the Cydroid will successfully abort dispensing and the countdown for the auto-dispense action will not be triggered until the next time the Cydroid’s E-ther storage is full.&nbsp;



The Second Civilian: Cydroid Technician



The Cydroid Technician automatically charges Cydroids on your property which have less than 100% charge. You can turn auto-charging of Cydroids On or Off at any time.&nbsp;







Level 1: 120 minute wait before charging



Level 2: 90 minute wait before charging



Level 3: 60 minute wait before charging



Level 4: 30 minute wait before charging



Level 5: 15 minute wait before charging



Level 6: 5 minute wait before charging



Whenever your Cydroids are Idle, the Cydroid Technician will continue to charge them so that they are fully charged and ready for the next raid.&nbsp;



The Third Civilian: Raid Commander



The Raid Commander automatically targets specific properties from your list of recent raids.&nbsp;







The exact properties that are targeted are selected by adding or removing the desired favourite icons in the Auto Target Properties list.&nbsp;







In the Raid Commander’s Ability Menu, the “NEW AUTO-RAID” button can be selected to manage your auto-raids. There, you can view and edit the Auto Target Properties list of selected favourite icons, view and edit which target properties are assigned which favourite icons, and even launch manual raids so that a desired target property can appear in your Recent list and be targeted in the next auto-raid.&nbsp;







For the Raid Commander to target a specific property:




The desired favourite icons must be added to the Raid Commander’s Auto Target Properties list,&nbsp;









The properties with the desired target (favourite) icon/s must be in your [Recent] raid history (i.e. you have manually raided that property at least once before), and









The Raid Commander must be at the required XP Level to raid the desired number of properties. (There is only 1 property in the AUTO-RAID list because a Level 1 Raid Commander can only be assigned 1 property to auto-raid at a time).&nbsp;








To check which properties your Raid Commander is targeting for auto-raids, simply select the A(U)TO RAID button to reveal the target property/ies.







If no properties appear on this list, make sure all the prerequisites for the Raid Commander Targeting System are met. Remember, you must specify which properties your Raid Commander should target by adding favourite icons to the Raid Commander’s Auto Raid Target list.&nbsp;









You can easily check which favourite icons are on a Raid Commander’s Auto Target Properties list by looking at the property card overview in the Raid interface:







Level 1: Auto-raid 1 Target property&nbsp;




120 minutes wait time before raiding



Always targets the most recently raided property included in the Auto Target Properties list.&nbsp;








Level 2: Auto-raid 2 Target properties




90 minutes wait time before raiding



Always targets the second most recently raided property included in the Auto Target Properties list, cycling through the top 2 recent raids.&nbsp;








Level 3: Auto-raid 3 Target properties




60 minutes wait time before raiding



Always targets the third most recently raided property included in the Auto Target Properties list, cycling through the top 3 recent raids.








Level 4: Auto-raid 4 Target properties




30 minutes wait time before raiding



Always targets the fourth most recently raided property included in the Auto Target Properties list, cycling through the top 4 recent raids.&nbsp;








Level 5: Auto-raid 5 Target properties




15 minutes wait time before raiding



Always targets the fifth most recently raided property included in the Auto Target Properties list, cycling through the top 5 recent raids.








Level 6: Auto-raid unlimited Target properties&nbsp;




5 minutes wait time before raiding



Always targets the oldest “recently” raided property included in the Auto Target Properties list, cycling through an unlimited number of raid targets.&nbsp;








Remember, setting a Raid Target with a specific Favourite Icon is a global setting for your account. This Raid Target property will have the same assigned Icon for all your Raid Commanders, no matter which property you are raiding from. However, the Recent Raids list of target properties are unique to each raid base property. Bear in mind that while you can create different Auto Raid Target lists for each of your properties’ Raid Commanders, you can only assign one favourite icon to a target property at a time. This is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage in raid management, it is simply an additional factor to consider when strategising your raid targets.



Here is an example:



Let’s say you have three properties around the same area, called Property A, Property B, and Property C.



All three properties have fully synthesised Civilians that are ready to roll.&nbsp;



Target X is a neighbouring property that is in raiding range of all three of your properties, and you have set the White Heart as the favourite icon for this target property.&nbsp;



Target X has also been manually raided before from Property A and Property B, but never from Property C.



If you decide to make the Raid Commander on Property A and Property C target all Icons, and the Raid Commander on Property B only target Blue Bird Icons, this is what the Auto Target list will look like for each of these properties:







Cydroids on Property A will be sent on an auto-raid to Target X because the property has been raided from Property A before and the White Heart icon is included in the Raid Commander’s Auto Target Properties list.&nbsp;







Cydroids on Property B will not be sent on an auto-raid to Target X, because the White Heart icon has not been specified in that property’s Raid Commander’s Auto Target Properties list.&nbsp;







Cydroids on Property C will never be sent on an auto-raid to Target X, because while the White Heart icon is on the Raid Commander’s Auto Target Properties list, Target X has never been raided from Property C before and is therefore not in its Recent Raids list.







HOT TIP: When Cydroids were first released, many Players built maximum Cydroids on all of their properties without considering gameplay strategy. We advise Players to not synthesise Civilians on properties that do not have any Cydroids, or whose Cydroids are inactive, as this is not sustainable.&nbsp;



However, if you are an active Raider, What are you waiting for?? Synthesise your Civilians, improve your raiding strategy and gain those XPs!&nbsp;&nbsp;



You can also check out our previous announcement which includes more details about the Raid Commander Targeting System and the Civilian XP system.  We updated some of the XP points required for different levels since the previous announcement which are reflected in the image below.







Note: The cost to synthesise and sustain Civilians, as well as the number of XP required to reach a certain Occupational Mastery Level are all game mechanic components that may be altered to improve the overall system. Any time-based action and times associated with each Civilian Level are also subject to future alterations.

Title: The Weaver, Prospecting Cydroids &amp; Resources
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/06/18/major-ecosim-update/

====================================================================================================
June 18, 2023 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211; As we continue to release different facets of the EcoSim, we find ourselves moving closer to a fully fledged, operational, base version. As part of the next steps, today marks the beginning of a process which will see the unveiling of 21 additional Resources, all of which will be discoverable on Player-owned properties! 



Periodically, one or more new Resources will be unveiled at a time, and the E2PRV system will open at the same time to accept claims for these Resources on Player-owned land. In this article, we will reveal the Prime Jewels for each Resource and details regarding the new Prospecting Cydroids, the Weaver, and their roles in the Resources system in Earth 2. 



As with most features of Earth 2, Resources have their own intricate design and more detailed information about this system is explained in this article. For those who would prefer to watch a video breakdown of this article please click the video URL at the bottom of this page. 



EcoSim: The Beginnings



As Earth 2 is progressing closer and closer towards the Alpha release of E2V1, many may be wondering:



“How will the next part of the EcoSim start?”&nbsp;



Beginning today, the EcoSim is a topic we will be addressing in a dedicated series of upcoming&nbsp; articles scheduled for release throughout the year. These articles will each detail the assets and processes that will be involved in the next stages of the EcoSim.&nbsp;



This series of articles is designed to progressively educate the Earth 2 community of the many features and mechanisms of the EcoSim and prepare Players for the final “EcoSim: Chronicles” announcement preceding the launch of what will become Version 1 of the EcoSim, when all early version EcoSim mechanics form full game loops. 



Resources &amp; Prime Jewels, which are covered more deeply in this article, are two of the cornerstones of the early EcoSim gameplay. Although we will not dive deeper into all of the practicalities of the EcoSim in this article, rest assured buildings, logistics (Production, Transport, Storage) and other accommodating features (Civilians, Cydroids, Jewels and much more) connecting everything together are all important parts of the Version 1 EcoSim and will be detailed in later articles. 



Resources



Whether you want to deliver and share an experience, play fully immersed inside the virtual world with digital assets and items, display ads, promote external games, sell physical goods via digital store fronts, share a link to external experiences, or create other general web1 e-commerce products or services, you are going to need land with buildings and infrastructure of some sort.  



How would you get these foundational facilities?  



Well, it all starts with RESOURCES.



Thus, Resources are a fundamental component of the EcoSim, kick-starting local and global supply chains, taking real-world attributes to enable the creation of objects within our metaverse. Just like in the real world, there will be many Resources in Earth 2, and multiple stages and ways to discover, replicate, and craft them into building blocks for different purposes.&nbsp;



Most recently, Silver and Copper Resources were released for Players to claim on their properties, and stake Essence via our Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) system. 21 additional Resources will now follow and progressively be released via E2PRV for claiming, on a 1 Resource per 1-2 week schedule after the first new Resource is revealed. All Resources in Earth 2 will have utility via the EcoSim and will be required to craft Building Blocks for future EcoSim assets and many other types of objects. The Discovery Tiers for these confirmed Resources and their respective Prime Jewels are listed below!&nbsp;







The Jewels have also received an important update to align their look and feel more closely with the Primary Resources they are associated with. The new look still follows the previous colour scheme but has the added benefit of being able to accommodate for future planned utilities and better fits their upcoming representation for inside E2V1. 



Raw Materials from Resources will be critical for any kind of progression in the EcoSim and we anticipate they will be a highly traded asset inside of Earth 2, in terms of volume. 



With the initial release of Resources, several related gameplay features will intentionally be excluded in order to provide a simpler, more accessible early-access version to Players on the current Earth 2 web version. These excluded features will gradually be introduced especially in E2V1, altering the mechanics and significantly increasing the complexity of Resource discovery and acquisition. Examples of the components scheduled for later release include localised inventories and logistics requirements.&nbsp;



It is important to remember that there will be gameplay activities to suit everyone in Earth 2, from “Players” to “Holders” to every-day “Users”. The Resource system is one of many different gameplay pathways that Players may choose to explore and specialise in. Finding an area of interest in Earth 2 is key to a fun, successful, and rewarding Player experience. However, most if not all paths within Earth 2 will start easy and progressively become more difficult to master, enabling anyone to experiment and explore. This type of gameplay pathway empowers anyone to improve their stats or expand their virtual portfolio by yielding higher rewards the more they choose to invest time and implement advanced strategies in the EcoSim.&nbsp;



Discovering &amp; Obtaining Resources



Most Resources in Earth 2 will be situated deep underground, much like Resources in the real world. As E-ther evaporates from the ground, it carries with it the binary data of Resources present in the land. This binary data is measured in Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



The binary data contained within E-ther is not easily interpreted by the Mentar which is only able to weakly read the Occurrence Units of Discovery Tier 1 Resources (refer to image above) whilst it is collecting the evaporated E-ther. To do this, Prime Jewels for the corresponding Resources are required to be slotted into the Mentar. This enables the binary data to flow through and the Occurrence Units to be deciphered by the Mentar, from the various binary data strings.&nbsp;



While the Mentar is able to read the binary data Occurrence Units contained in E-ther, its reading capabilities are very poor and much of the data is lost in the E-ther collection process.



Prospecting Cydroids



Due to the inefficient reading capabilities of the Mentar, alternative methods for decoding the binary data had to be innovated in order to access higher Discovery tiers of Resources and to optimise reading efficiency. 



Raiders would soon discover that their Raid Cydroids could be modified by fusing Prime Jewels into them which allow them to read binary data, owing to the intrinsic Cydroid technology already enabling them to detect and capture E-ther. Many attempts using Prime Jewels to re-engineer the Raid Cydroids did in fact fail and it was quickly noted that each Cydroid type had a Jewel colour it could be successfully fused with. 



Depending on the tier and quality of the Prime Jewel the Raid Cydroid was fused with it and in the process was granted chances of allowing more dedicated Resource slots. Fusing a Brilliant Jewel gave additional perks of more Power cells slots. Other possible benefits are yet unknown.  



The successfully modified Cydroids were able to implement the reading technology far better than the Mentar itself. However, each Cydroid type was only specialised in discovering and reading one specific type of Resource. Reading and capturing a Resource&#8217;s Occurrence Units occurs at the point of E-ther collection, extracting the Occurrence Units Data directly into the Cydroids memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Thus Prime Jewels were proven necessary to modify Raid Cydroids granting the additional function of Prospecting, to read Resource Occurrence Units, and at a higher, more accurate rate than the Mentar. Results from early experimentation also revealed that the additional Resource slots obtained could support supplementary Jewels enhancing the effects of the fused Prime Jewel. Through this experimentation of Cydroid modifications and Jewel fusion, the blueprints for Prospecting Cydroids were invented.&nbsp;



It quickly became clear that Prospecting Cydroids would be key to discovering higher Discovery Tier Resources on Player-owned land. As the demand for Prospecting Cydroids increased, the later Prospecting Cydroids were manufactured and built for purpose, rather than modified from existing Raid Cydroids. However, these purpose-built Prospecting Cydroids would not have the ability to raid thus creating many new potential scenarios for Landowners to consider. 



Manufactured Prospecting Cydroids will not require a Jewel to be fused. 



Additionally, manufacturing Prospecting Cydroids from scratch requires quite a substantial amount of Raw material and Building blocks. Prospecting Cydroids with lower rarity require less Raw material when manufactured meaning the lower the rarity associated with the Ethereal Cydroid, the easier it will be to manufacture a non-Ethereal class Cydroid. 



To improve their strategies, Landowners were faced with more decisions, such as whether their Prospecting Raid Cydroids should be sent to other properties to raid E-ther and obtain “foreign” Occurrence Units, or be kept on their own property to collect and read their own Occurrence Units. 



And if these Cydroids were to remain on the property, then should it be the Mentar or the Prospecting Raid Cydroid that collects the E-ther? 



Beyond the questions of how Occurrence Units should be obtained, Landowners would also need to decide which Resource(s) to prioritise. 



Given that Occurrence Unit reading occurs at the point of E-ther collection, Landowners would also need to decide the amount of E-ther and which Resources would be targeted by the Mentar and each of the Prospecting Raid Cydroids.&nbsp;



Experimenting with different strategies is key for Landowners to discover what works best for them. E.g. aim for more E-ther by having the Mentar that is packed with E-ther boosting Jewels collect more E-ther, or let Prospecting Cydroids collect E-ther to prioritise Resource yield.&nbsp;



Daily E-ther brings with it new Occurrence Units to extract. Once the binary data is extracted, the Prospecting Cydroid will be required to dispense the collected E-ther to the global balance for the E-ther &amp; Occurrence Units to be accounted for. E-ther and Occurrence Units collected by the Mentar will immediately be accounted for,&nbsp; without the need to dispense.&nbsp;



Frequency &amp; Occurrence Units



Most Players will already be aware that Resources are distributed in certain areas with High (HF) or “Unknown” (UF) Frequency and that these frequency categories are assigned per property. The actual distribution of Resources will occur in the near future where each land tile will be assigned a frequency per Resource. 



For example, a 750 tile property will have a Frequency assigned to each of the individual 750 tiles. Furthermore, Players will be able to see 5 Frequency Categories: Deficient, Sparse, Moderate, Rich and Copious, the latter being what is currently known as High Frequency. 



A property will always be assigned a dominant frequency (E.g. Copious Frequency) but the individual tiles making up the property will still have their own frequency categories assigned to them, and potentially even a few tiles with no Resource frequency at all. In other words, a property that has been assigned Copious Frequency for a Resource will still consist of tiles that each range from no frequency all the way up to Copious. 



A property that has been assigned Moderate Frequency for a Resource will consist of tiles that each range from no frequency to Moderate Frequency only. While a property that is “Copious” will not likely consist of tiles which are all assigned the Copious Frequency, they will still have more Occurrence Units in the ground than a property of a lower Frequency category.



For now, Landowners can only see if a Resource exists on their Property. Neither the precise frequency category nor the Occurrence Unit information will be available initially, except for those whose properties have been assigned HF (a.k.a Copious Frequency).&nbsp;



Players will be able to discover different Resource Discovery tiers by participating in the E2PRV Scheme (claiming) to unveil and confirm the frequency of Resources attributed to their properties. However, Prospecting Cydroids may also be able to help with this process in the future as well. 



The ability to access Occurrence Units insights requires the employment of a Geologist Civilian (yet to be released). 



Although it is possible to replicate Resources via the Weaver without knowing the Occurrence Units and without a Geologist Civilian, to optimise the replication process it is highly recommended to synthesise a Geologist Civilian to gain access to these insights. 



Read more about the Weaver &amp; Replication process below.



The Read Process: Yielding Occurrence Units



The quantities of Occurrence Units contained within the evaporated E-ther fluctuate on a daily basis. This volatility can be stabilised and increased by using Jewels to boost the read quality of the “Reader”, Prospecting Cydroid or Mentar, of a particular Resource.&nbsp;



As each prospecting Cydroid will need to collect its own E-ther, and filter and read the binary data through the slotted Prime Jewel, it may be quite difficult to extract the full amount of Daily Occurrence Units of a Resource. To attempt it, a Landowner would need to allow the Prospecting Cydroid to collect all the E-ther, as well as boost the reading quality with the optimal configuration of slotted Jewels.&nbsp;



Landowners owning modified Raid Cydroids are also able to obtain Occurrence Units from other Players&#8217; properties by Raiding their E-ther when using a Prospecting Cydroid able to discover the Resource that exists within the target property.&nbsp;&nbsp;



The collected Occurrence Unit data must either be immediately used in the Weaver for Resource Replication, or stored in Holobuildings for later use (detailed below).&nbsp;



Players will also have the option to improve a Prospecting Cydroid’s reading ability by directly injecting Essence into the Power Cell of the Cydroid while it is recharging, thereby creating a temporary boost effect enabling the Cydroid&nbsp; to consume/extract more Occurrence Unit data than what is actually present in the ground. This temporary effect requires&nbsp; Essence to be irreversibly consumed. Strategy and balancing mechanics are involved when utilising this type of boost and will be further elaborated on in a future announcement.



As mentioned above, to obtain an approximate understanding of the daily availability of O.U. (Occurrence Units) and m3 (cubic meters), Players must train a civilian in geological knowledge, The Geologist. Furthermore, by equipping the Geologist skill to the Cydroid E-ther Reckoner, Players can unlock the new Mastery Head Reckoner granting the insights of O.U. and m3 when yielding the Resources from the ground and how much is stored in the Holobuilding storages. 



Adding the Geologist skill to the Raw Material Tailor managing the Weaver grants insights into how long time the replication process will take and how much m3 it will result in.



This allows Players to gain valuable information about the Resources present in the ground, yielded by the Prospect Cydroids/Mentar and stored in the holobuildings and replication outcomes by the Weaver.&nbsp;



It&#8217;s important to note that without the Geologist skill in these areas, Players can still perform the necessary processes, but they won&#8217;t have access to the specific quantity information at each step.



Holobuilding Storage



All Holobuildings have the ability to store Resource Occurrence Units. Players who already have Holobuildings built on their properties will have Occurrence Units already stored when Resource launches. Up to 1000 m3 Holobuilding space per property will be eligible for the retroactive Occurrence Units reward and each m3 has the capacity to store a certain amount of Occurrence Units (To be disclosed). 



However, the Occurrence Unit storage capacity will not be restricted to 1000 m3 of Holobuilding space once Occurrence Units are officially released and actively yielding. Players may opt to construct more space to increase the Occurrence Unit storage capacity of their Holobuildings at this point in time and beyond.  



The Holobuilding storage capacity is local to the property and Occurrence Units cannot be transferred to other properties.



Detached holobuildings will still act as one local storage for the property, any m3 existing on the property is totaled up to the properties total O.U. storage capacity. Once the Occurrence Units are in the property&#8217;s local reserve, the Player will be able to see how much O.U. space that is stored and remains as well as the amount of m3 would equate to if running it through the Weaver. 



Removing an already constructed Holobuilding from a property could risk the Player’s local storage capacity to go below what is required for the amount of Occurrence Units already stored. In the instance where the local storage drops below the amount of Occurrence Units currently stored, the equivalent amount  of Occurrence Units to the storage space removed will be discarded. 



Likewise, if the maximum local storage capacity is reached and more Occurrence Units are attempted to be deposited, these Occurrence Units will immediately be lost. 



The Head Reckoner will play a crucial role for Players to gain insights on their local storage capacity to ensure they maintain enough storage space for the Occurrence Units they wish to collect.&nbsp;



Replication Process: Raw Materials (m3)



Collected Occurrence Unit data can be imported into the Weaver and used to create the physical Raw Material. This is better known as the replication process.&nbsp;



In contrast to the reading process, the Weaver is not able to replicate Raw Materials instantly. The capacity of a Weaver to replicate Raw Materials within a 24 hour period is determined by the Weaver’s runtime (including the required cooldown time) and production pace. Both the runtime and production pace can be improved and optimised. The base level Weaver can only replicate one Resource at a time and the Player will need to prioritise which Raw Materials to produce first.&nbsp; In the future, it will become possible to build more Weavers to further increase Raw Material production and enable different Raw Materials to be replicated simultaneously.&nbsp;



Prime Jewels are once again key to unlocking replication, as the process involves the Occurrence Units to flow through the Prime Jewel of the corresponding Resource in order to print the desired raw material. 



To optimise the Weaver’s replication pace, a Player will need to reconfigure the Weaver with different combinations of Jewels which in turn boost the Resource production. This, reconfiguration between raw material productions, can be done manually or with the help of the Raw Material Tailor Civilian auto-reconfiguring the Weaver. The Raw Material Tailor will also enable insights for how much time a Resource will take to replicate and how much volume (m3) it will produce.   



The Weaver’s replication technology is advanced resulting in long cooldowns. A small operational team of Civilians can be employed to learn the production process and utilise the Weaver’s full replication capacity. As the Civilian team gains more experience with replicating a particular Resource, they will naturally learn how that Resource behaves when being printed and optimises the Weaver’s runtime for that Resource using this knowledge and experience.&nbsp;



Storing &amp; Selling Raw Material m3



When Resources finally take their physical form through the Replication process, they will occupy a certain amount of m3 (Cubic metre) space. At the beginning of the EcoSim this capacity to store Raw Materials will be quite limited inside the initial buildings. Once progressing in the EcoSim the Player can decide to expand this storage to their required levels.&nbsp;



Raw materials will be tradeable in the Bazaar. Logistics will be a key requirement for transporting Raw Materials to buyers however, inside E2V1 (Future Feature).

A few Q&amp;As



Q: How do I collect Occurence Units ?&nbsp;



A: Resource Occurrence Unit data is obtained when E-ther is collected. Either through the Mentar slotted with a Prime Jewel or by utilising Prospecting Cydroids. However, Prospecting Cydroids will be required to Dispense the E-ther into the Mentar before the Occurrence Units are accounted for.



Q: What is the difference when yielding Occurrence Units from the Mentar &amp; Prospecting Cydroids



A. The Mentar can only read Resources belonging to Discovery Tier 1 and at a reduced yield rate. However, the Mentar also has the ability to read multiple Resources if several Prime Jewels are slotted into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Prospecting Cydroids are specialised in one specific Resource though the yield rate is much higher than the Mentar’s and specific Prospecting Cydroids are required to yield Resources in Discovery Tier 2 and up.&nbsp;



Q: What is the difference between manufactured Prospecting Cydroids vs Raid Cydroids upgraded to Prospecting Cydroids



A. Raid (Ethereal) Cydroids fused with a Prime Jewel will keep its raiding functionality making them able to raid not only E-ther but also Occurrence Units from Landfield targets while potentially keeping other utility and abilities they may receive over time. 



Purpose built (manufactured) Prospecting Cydroids will not require a Jewel to be constructed but rather Raw materials and can only harvest Occurrence units from the landowners own property as they do not have the ability to collect E-ther from properties they are not tethered with. 



Q: What impacts the amount of Occurrence Units I can collect ?&nbsp;



A: The Occurrence Units value collectible from a property depends on the Availability in the ground and the performance of the Mentar or Prospecting Cydroid collecting the Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



The Resource availability in the ground is affected by the tile’s attributes:&nbsp;




Tier



Class



Frequency Category




Players will be able to discover different Resource Discovery tiers by participating in the E2PRV Scheme (claiming) to unveil the frequency of Resources attributed to their properties. However, Prospecting Cydroids may have the ability to discover Resources in the future as well.



The performance of the Mentar or Prospecting Cydroid is affected by:&nbsp;




Jewel Resource Boost



Prospect Cydroid Upgrades



Temporal Essence Boost. Essence can overcharge and temporarily increase the maximum amount of Occurence Units that exist in the ground (Future feature).&nbsp;




Q: Can I transfer my Occurence Units to other properties?&nbsp;



No, the Occurrence Units stored in local Holobuildings will be locked to that property. When Selling a Holobuilding (removing it from the property) the Occurrence Units will be lost, as Occurrence Units stored in Holobuildings are not transferable between different properties and Players.&nbsp;



Q: What do I need to do to start replicating Resources into Raw Materials?&nbsp;



A: Occurrence Units of a Resource and the corresponding Prime Jewel slotted into the weaver. E.g. Oil Occurence Units will require to slot the Black Jewel







Q: What impacts how much m3 I can produce with my collected Occurence Units ?



A: The Weaver’s runtime capacity before needing to cool down and the production pace. Both parameters can be improved via Civilians, Jewel boost, Weaver Upgrades and more with specific details to be released.



E.g. Slotting Jewels increases the production pace.







Q: What is required to store Raw materials?&nbsp;



A. When the Resource Replication feature is launched, the Player will gain more info about the structure and the various extra utilities this building will carry including the storage capacity for replicated Raw Materials.&nbsp;



Q: Do I need to transport my Raw Materials when selling or constructing?



A. Logistics requirements will not be implemented with the early release of Resources, replication and fabrication. However, will be added later to increase deeper Gameplay.

Title: E2PRV: Chance To Appeal Claims Marked For Rejection
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/06/23/claim-rejection-appeals/

====================================================================================================
June 23, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; The first round of Resource Validations is coming to a close with the vast majority of Gold, Oil, Coal, Iron Ore and Limestone claims being approved for distribution on Earth 2 to date! Many Players have already made incredible returns through the Essence Staking feature of the E2PRV system, as well as submitted successful claims which resulted in their properties being attributed the claimed Resource/s, something that will become very important as the EcoSim continues to roll out. 



Although the CAT (Claims Approval Team) have done a fantastic job of evaluating claims -and reviewing them- unfortunately the remaining claims still &#8220;Under Investigation&#8221; have all been marked as invalid and are pending rejection.&nbsp; It was promising to see that most Players successfully followed the guidelines for creating a successful claim and that the minor number of remaining claims marked for rejection are by large due to claims that were submitted with either insufficient or inaccurate supporting evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We specifically designed and implemented the ‘Assurance Fee’ as a safeguard to help improve the quality of submitted claims and ultimately avoid any rejections and subsequent loss of this fee and any Essence staked by Players. Although there are only a minor number of claims flagged for rejection, it was still concerning that some Players ignored the guidelines and the purpose behind this system which was first and foremost to minimise any loss and maximise gains for Players.



While we have taken great measures and spent significant human resources to review claims marked for rejection, we understand that there is a possible margin for error with missed or inconsistent reviews. From the offset of the E2PRV system it was made clear that Earth 2 reserves the right to reject any claim at its own discretion. So as much as we would love to wrap up the original E2PRV claims at once, instead of taking the easier option and exercising our discretional right to reject all remaining claims and move on, we decided to give Players one last opportunity to submit an appeal for their pending-rejection claims.&nbsp;



This appeal will give Players who believe that their claim is in fact valid and should be approved a chance to bring their claim to the attention of the CAT one last time without their claims simply being rejected. This opportunity is only for original claims (gold, iron, limestone, oil, coal) which are still under investigation, meaning they have been marked for rejection. The appeal is NOT a chance for Players to submit additional evidence and should only be made by those who are certain that they have:




Provided sufficient evidence proving the claimed Resource exists in a specific location, and



Ensured that the location of their claim property directly corresponds to the location of the evidence provided above.&nbsp;




Many claims pending rejection simply did not provide sufficient evidence, or the evidence provided was valid but the location did not correspond to that of their property.&nbsp;



To provide transparency and clarity so that Players understand the type of details we have had to deal with on pending rejected claims, here are some examples of the insufficient / invalid evidence that have been commonly provided by Players in claims currently marked for rejection :



Invalid Claim A:Resource:CoalLocation:-33.856535, 151.215333DescriptionThere is coal on my property, see screenshot of Global Energy Map.&nbsp;Linkshttps://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-mine-tracker/tracker-map/&nbsp;AttachmentsReason Invalid:&nbsp;There are coal mines in Australia, and operational mines near Bargo and in Appin and Helensburgh, but the map overlay over Sydney actually shows an area for “cancelled mines” and the specific mine locators do not correspond with the claim location. This means the provided Resource area is too broad, with no other supporting evidence provided for the specific property location, the claim cannot be validated.&nbsp;



Invalid Claim B:Resource:GoldLocation:-33.82333, 150.91778DescriptionValidate gold on my property! There is quartz on my property and gold is associated with quartz, therefore I should have gold here.&nbsp;Linkshttps://rappellingequipment.com/quartz-and-gold-relationship/https://www.mindat.org/loc-106.htmlhttps://www.mindat.org/min-3337.html&nbsp;AttachmentsReason Invalid:&nbsp;Rappellingequipment.com is not a credible source for Resource validation.&nbsp;Pure speculation: the presence of quartz does not guarantee the occurrence of goldNo evidence provided for proof of gold in this location / provided evidence does not prove the presence of gold in this location



Invalid Claim C:Resource:OilLocation:5.289539, 115.252976DescriptionSee link and attachments &#8211; there is oil on my property!&nbsp;Linkshttps://www.oilmap.xyz/https://www.petronas.com/sites/mpm/files/download/2020%20MBR%20Technical%20Pack%20(Updated).pdf&nbsp;AttachmentsReason Invalid:&nbsp;Information provided shows bid-round blocks for oil exploration ONLYExploration has not yet taken place and no oil has yet been produced &#8211; but even more importantly- nor discovered here.&nbsp;



Invalid Claim D:Resource:Iron OreLocation:Arkalyk, Kostanay Province, KazakhstanDescriptionAluminium of Kazakhstan JSCTurgaiskojeUnfortunately hardly any sources found about the aluminum occurrence.Linkshttps://www.erg.kz/en/content/deyatel-nost/ao-alyuminiy-kazahstana , https://www.erg.kz/en&nbsp;AttachmentsReason Invalid:&nbsp;Aluminium is not iron ore. Evidence provided is also insufficient, regardless of Resource:&nbsp;Link 1 &#8211;&nbsp; Aluminium production in Kazakhstan &#8211; no location correspondence to claim propertyLink 2 &#8211; map of assets in Kazakhstan &#8211; general city reference, not specific to the property location &#8211; no specific information about actual occurrence&nbsp;



Please remember these examples are just that &#8211; examples only. Each location and claimed Resource will require information and evidence specific to those factors to be successfully validated.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We would like to give Players as much time as possible to review without being rushed. Therefore, Players will have 6 weeks to make an appeal for any claims still Under Investigation.&nbsp;



The hard deadline for making appeals is Sunday the 6th of August, 2023. Please note that if an appeal is granted, the claim will be approved. If the appeal is rejected, the claim will remain under investigation and be rejected in the final mass rejections update. You can keep track of your appeals by checking your Claims Manager for claim status updates. Depending on any backlog, there will be a period of time after appeals close so that the CAT may complete any approvals for successful appeals.&nbsp;



To submit your Resource Claim Rejection Appeal, please follow the Google Form link below:



https://forms.gle/QDsM9jM4LHEDRLzJ7



Before you submit an appeal claim, check that:




You have provided sufficient evidence in your original claim



The Resource you claimed matches the evidence you provided



The location of your evidence matches the location of your claim&nbsp;




If any of the above conditions have not been met, your appeal will not be successful.&nbsp;

Article 60
Title: E2PRV: Claim Approval Guidelines for Copper and Silver Resources
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/06/23/copper-silver-guidelines/

====================================================================================================
June 23, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Before we get too far along with the new Resource releases, we wanted to reiterate guidelines to our community and provide clear examples of what we find acceptable or not.  With the lower reward for successful claims, this is about Players wanting to confirm a resource on their property and the community &#8216;collaborating&#8217; to validate those claims.



The CAT has finished processing all Copper and Silver Resource claims that have been submitted to date, with the first lot of approvals to start today! Players participating in the E2PRV system and Essence staking will be pleased to know that moving forward, our dedicated CAT will be aiming to execute approvals more regularly, ensuring claims for new resource types are approved in a more consistent manner (although there still may be a backlog from time to time, depending on how many Players use the system).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



UPDATE ON COPPER &amp; SILVER CLAIMS



The current backlog of Copper and Silver claims will be cleared by the CAT shortly. These claims have all been evaluated and are only waiting for final approvals and rejections. While we have a vast majority of Copper and Silver claims which will be approved on a regular basis, a significant number are still pending rejection. This delay in finalising claims was caused by the large number of claims that were submitted with insufficient or invalid evidence.&nbsp;



We have previously stated that Player’s should follow guidelines we have shared on how to submit valid claims, rather than reference claims which have already been approved. This is because the method used to distribute Resources based on validated claims results in automatic approval of any claims that fall under a defined area for a Resource occurrence (e.g. mine site). So some claims which provide little or no evidence still have the potential to be approved because they happen to fall within the defined area of a validated claim.&nbsp;



However, Players cannot rely on their claims being approved in this way and should always ensure their claim is submitted with accompanying geographically accurate and credible evidence.



If you don’t have that pioneering blood in you or are just not confident about creating a claim, you can always check the claim heatmap or resource heatmap to locate areas where Silver, Copper or other new resource types and/or claims may exist.



GUIDELINE FOR CLAIM SUBMISSION



To help our Players, here is a guideline of what evidence types will be accepted and what evidence types will be rejected. Sometimes there are special cases and the CAT will always have precedence in determining what will constitute a successful/unsuccessful claim.&nbsp; Following these examples will give your claim the highest chance of approval.



Accepted Evidence Types:




Mindat link (mindat.com)

An existing mine/mining complex with the name and exact location and the claimed resource listed



A defined area of occurrence with the exact location and the claimed resource listed



An historic mine with the name and exact location and the claimed resource listed





Academic research

Highlight the specific details that support the evidence rather than attaching the entire paper (Remember &#8211; it is not the CAT’s job to find information to support your claim!)



Must be from a credible source!





Press media report

Must be from a credible source!



Depending on the length of the report, highlight the specific details that support the evidence rather than attaching the entire paper





Government report

Highlight the specific details that support the evidence



Make sure the projects /plans are confirmed or implemented. Future plans/prospecting will not be accepted!





Resource-rich mountains/veins



Exact name &amp; location of the mountain/vein



Proof of resource occurrence



USGS Mineral Resources Database (https://mrdata.usgs.gov/)

Exact name and location of the mine/ occurrence



Check the category of the entry (A,B,C,D or E) as that will also affect the strength of this evidence type






All evidence must state the Resource occurrence location as corresponding to the claim location and the Resource being claimed. Supplementary evidence is required when there is any ambiguous or contradictory evidence provided within the above sources. Some sources do not provide specific enough information. While we do accept the above sources predominantly, they are often cross-checked to ensure the information is accurate. Therefore, Players must always ensure the information contained is factually, geographically accurate.&nbsp;



Rejected Evidence Types:




Mindat link for a general city/region/country &#8211; often if you select the resource in the list, it will reveal the exact mine/s and/or occurrence locations within that city, which subsequently can be used. General areas neither are location specific nor prove the occurrence of the resource on your property

This does not mean there is gold in Sydney: 



Select the (i) icon to reveal the exact occurrence of gold within Sydney: 



The exact location is revealed, like so: 





MRData-USGS links that do not contain specific coordinates and/or which contain information about a general city / area (this is not specific enough!)

Refer to the category grading details provided here: https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/&nbsp;



See the grade here (higher the grade, the higher the likelihood of having your claim approved): 





No prospecting/exploration areas (the resource must be confirmed through physical proof!)

Only generic exploration zones are shown here, supplementary evidence is required to prove Resource production in this location:





Mineral description from Mindat &#8211; this is supplementary evidence only and is insufficient if provided without any location references specific to the claim property



General resource/interactive maps &#8211; again these are not location specific and must either be zoomed in to an appropriate scale for your property, or be used to supplement other credible evidence.

This is insufficient evidence as it is not location specific: 



Note that the brown overlay indicates areas of coal fields and they are not an accurate reference to specific coal mines! 





Water resource occurrence claims as to containing minerals will not be accepted.&nbsp;



Artificial products made from the claimed Resource.&nbsp;




In addition to the above clarifications, we have provided some examples of current claims below, which have been marked for rejection due to insufficient or invalid evidence.&nbsp;



Claim ID:77264Resource:SilverLocation:Tadjourah, DjiboutiPlayer Backing:100%Evidence Provided:Reason for Rejection: No evidence provided &#8211; only “Tadjourah” in Description text field.&nbsp;



Claim ID:77285Resource:CopperLocation:Akrotiri, Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and DhekeliaPlayer Backing:100%Evidence Provided:Reason for Rejection: Insufficient evidence &#8211; Wikipedia link to general mining industry of Cyprus does not mention specific location corresponding to the claimed property or the resources found there. The CAT conducted additional research (which they are not obligated to do!)&nbsp; in case there might be evidence to support the resource in this location &#8211; none could be found.&nbsp;



Claim ID:77287Resource:CopperLocation:Livorno, ItalyPlayer Backing100%Evidence Provided:Reason for Rejection: The location provided in the evidence is too far from the claim property location (I.e. locations do not correlate).&nbsp;



Claim ID:77290Resource:SilverLocation:Rudna, Powiat Lubiński, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, PolandPlayer Backing100%Evidence Provided:Reason for Rejection: Insufficient evidence &#8211; no supporting description is provided and the provided link is for the resource in a general country rather than a specific location. Further research into Rudna mine shows it is too far away from the claimed property location (~16km away).



Please note that at this stage, claims marked for rejection have intentionally been left as “Open” status to allow the submitting Player to withdraw(remove) the claim themselves.&nbsp;



Furthermore, all Silver and Copper claims which have already been updated to “Under Investigation” status but are marked for rejection will be reimbursed by the CAT.&nbsp;



Other claims submitted before the 24th of June, 2023, which are still “Open” may be removed by the Player. If a claim with insufficient/invalid evidence is not withdrawn by the Player within a reasonable time, those claims will be updated to &#8220;Under Investigation&#8221; and rejected in due course.&nbsp;



Please note that this only applies to claims submitted prior to the 24th of June, 2023. After this date, all claims will be processed as per the set procedure and will be updated to Under Investigation upon evaluation, allowing the CAT to move through the claims at maximum efficiency and get valid claims approved quickly.&nbsp;



Now that the reward and approval turn around on new claims should be more consistent, we strongly encourage Players to continue collaborating with each other but please be mindful when using shared information that the evidence is specific to your claim location.&nbsp;

Title: Optional Campaign: Pre-E2V1 Resource Solution for  Wood, Water &amp; Sand
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/07/05/wood-water-sand-campaign/

====================================================================================================
July 5 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Wood, Water and Sand are 3 of the original 8 Resources officially announced for the Earth 2 EcoSim. They are crucial EcoSim Resources but unlike the other 5 Resources which have already been released through the E2PRV (Player Resource Validation) system and made available for Players to claim, Wood, Water and Sand will be distributed via E2V1 directly.



Until E2V1 is released, we have designed a special &#8211; optional &#8211; campaign for those Players participating in the various pre-Resource generation initiatives, to honour our promise of backdated Resource Occurrence Unit (OU) storage in Holobuildings for these 3 Resources .&nbsp;



Backdated Resources Campaign for Water, Wood &amp; Sand&nbsp;



There will be a specific campaign dedicated to ensuring Wood, Water and Sand Resources storage will be awarded to all eligible Players who are actively participating in the backdated Resources initiative by slotting relevant Jewels and constructing Holobuildings on their properties.&nbsp;



As is well known among the community, Players must actively slot a Prime Jewel into their Mentar in order to start gathering backdated Occurrence Units for the Resources released to date which are associated with that Jewel. 



Our special backdating campaign for Wood, Water and Sand adapts this pre-existing requirement as slotting the relevant Prime Jewel is something Players would have had to do anyway in order to start gathering OUs for the respective Resource.



This special campaign will run for 7 weeks, until  11:59pm UTC on the 23rd of August, 2023 (previously 11:59pm UTC on August 16, 2023), in order to provide Players (especially those with a large portfolio of properties) the time and opportunity to slot their desired Prime Jewels into the relevant properties. 



Please remember, this special campaign is completely OPTIONAL and is a reward tailored towards Players who were already taking advantage of the backdated Resource Occurrence Unit initiative.&nbsp; Players can choose NOT to participate in this special campaign, and STILL receive Water, Wood and/or Sand on their property if their property is in the appropriate location for those Resources allocated inside E2V1 upon its release.&nbsp;



To be eligible for the backdated storage of Wood, Water and/or Sand Occurrence Units, the following criteria must be met.



Between now and August 23, 2023 (previously August 16, 2023), each participating Property:




Must be slotted with a Prime Jewel for Wood, Water and/or Sand (of any Tier or Quality);&nbsp;



Must have a Holobuilding on the property (more details about the Holobuilding/s below);&nbsp;



Is eligible to receive up to a collective maximum of 1000m3 of backdated OU from all the Holobuildings constructed on that property combined. E.g. If the combined constructed volume of HBs on a property is 5000m3, up to 1000m3 Resource OU will be backdated; and



That does NOT have any other Resources attributed to it yet will receive an additional 50% increase in backdated OUs applied (as long as all other criteria are also met).&nbsp;




Players will need to utilise and slot their Prime Jewels on any properties they own which do not yet have any Resources detected to take advantage of this 50% bonus.



Between now and August 23, 2023 (previously August 16, 2023), each Holobuilding:




Must already be  constructed on a property, or constructed on a property before August 23, 2023 (previously August 16, 2023); and



Must be a minimum of 1m3 in constructed volume to receive an equal volume of backdated OUs to HB volume, up to a maximum of 1000m3 backdated OU storage space per property.




If all of the above criteria are met successfully then Occurrence Units for the Resource associated with the slotted Prime Jewel will be fully backdated once the Earth 2 Resource Generation system is fully released via the distribution of Occurrence Units.&nbsp; Therefore, in the future, when OUs are distributed, the system will detect and compute backdated OUs in the available storage for all qualifying properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;



This opportunity will still work for Players after August 23, 2023 (previously August 16, 2023), however, properties slotted and built on or after this date will not receive the full historic backdate to 2021 but rather initiate their backdated date from the day they slotted and built the HB.



So be sure to leave your Prime Jewel slotted and any Holobuildings constructed until such time OUs are distributed. If any or both are removed, the backdating period is wiped and restarts from when all the above criteria are once again met.



IMPORTANT TIPS :&nbsp;




Technically, under the above special guidelines, a Green Prime Jewel can be placed on a property that is located in the middle of the ocean with a Holobuilding built on it and be successfully backdated with Occurrence Units storage for Wood. However, once E2V1 is live it is highly unlikely that such a property in the middle of the ocean will still qualify for detecting Wood OUs as a valid Resource given its location in the middle of the ocean where there are no trees. Under such circumstances, the Player would need to replace the slotted Green Jewel with a Blue Jewel, to collect Water Occurrence Units moving forward as that property will no longer be able to generate Wood Occurrence Units once E2V1 is released.



We highly suggest Players consider which Resource has the highest probability of being present on their property inside E2V1 when deciding which one of either the Green, Blue or Sandy Prime Jewel to slot on their property. This will minimise&nbsp; the possibility of needing to slot the “correct” Jewel for Water, Wood or Sand inside E2V1 at a later date.&nbsp;



Players will be able to collect a maximum of 1,000m3 backdated OUs per property using their HB storage space.&nbsp; So if a Player has a constructed HB that is 5,000m3 in volume / storage space, only 1,000m3 of that space will be awarded backdated Resource OU. The remaining 4,000m3 will become usable&nbsp; once resource generation is officially released and Players can actively collect Resource OUs.



Backdated Resource OUs will cover multiple Resource types if the correct Jewels are slotted with the corresponding Resource attributed to that property. Under such scenarios, the backdated Resource OUs will be evenly distributed depending on Jewel slotting date and HB creation date. So if you have Gold, Water and Limestone or a property and have all the correct prime Jewels slotted, the backdated Resource OUs will be evenly split between Gold, Water and Limestone, but a warning, the split percentage will also be dependent on the resource frequency for each resource on that property.



Go to Resources &gt; Storage &gt; Slotting to access the new resource filter option in order to filter properties you own based on the resource they have detected. You can also filter properties with &#8220;No Resources&#8221; to take advantage of the backdated 50% boost on OUs.




Side Notes



We are not guaranteeing that trees located in E1 will be in the exact same place inside E2V1, especially if they are isolated trees. However, as E2V1 is a pristine version of Earth there will also be trees in areas you might not expect especially urban areas that have been developed by man, inside E2V1. So there will not be a lack of trees, in fact from what we have experienced there may even be more tree-spread than on E1.



With regards to water, we have invested a considerable amount of time ensuring that water locations are accurate inside E2V1 so that the vast majority of the world’s water source locations are accurately reflected. That being the case, please remember that Earth is incredibly large so there may be some noticeable absences, especially concerning smaller and/or newer bodies of water.

Title: New Look Revealed for Jewels and the Jewel Inventory!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/07/22/jewels-and-inventory-update/

====================================================================================================
July 22, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; For the first time since the release of Jewels on the Earth 2 platform, the entire Jewel system including the Jewel inventory and the Jewels themselves have had a brand new facelift to better reflect the updated branding of our website and upcoming plans for the representation of Jewels inside E2V1.&nbsp;



Jewels are tradable digital assets that can randomly spawn from Player-owned properties without any additional cost.&nbsp; They can currently be slotted into Mentars for various boost effects, crafted into different Jewels and Jewel qualities (Cracked, Cloudy, Common, Clear, Luminous and Brilliant), and traded on the Bazaar for E$ (Earth 2 currency that is withdrawable to fiat; E$ 1 = $1USD). With the progressive release of the Resources layer of the EcoSim, as well as the upcoming Cydroid Management system, the extent of Jewel utility will further be revealed.&nbsp;



New Look and Jewel Recap



The new look Earth 2 Jewels will fit better within the E2V1 3D environment.&nbsp; Each Jewel has been specifically designed and created by the Earth 2 art team to aesthetically represent the type of Jewel it is and the Resource it is related to.&nbsp; You will notice that each Jewel has one of 3 different textures which are also determined by the Resource; crystalline (transparent), polished (metallic) and coarse.&nbsp;



Not only are these Jewels more beautiful and more realistic to look at, but we find them to be more desirable and that&#8217;s even before taking into consideration the boosts and benefits that these Jewels can provide Players long term.



Every Jewel that spawns from a Player’s property is intrinsically linked to a specific Resource and depending on the Resource it is linked to, each Jewel has their own captivating look. Check out the fresh 41 new looks for Jewels below:







Jewel Inventory Interface Upgrade



The Jewel Inventory’s new UI has been designed and built to accommodate the various utilities that Jewels have and will have within Earth 2. In particular, the upcoming Cydroid Management system which will allow Players to slot Jewels into their Cydroids for different boost effects.



The updated interface gives a better, clearer overview of a Player’s Inventory of Jewels:







In addition to the standard Sort By and Filter options, Players have the option to view all Jewels in the inventory:





In stacks of the same Jewel type (Tier, Colour and Quality);&nbsp;










As individual Jewels; or










Categorised by either Tier or Colour.











These options make slotting easier for Players, especially with the new slotting functionality which enables Players to select an entire stack of the same Jewel type into a property’s Mentar and the best Jewel from that stack will automatically fill the slot. This will save a lot of time for Players as they are no longer required to sift through their inventory for the best Jewel with the best boosts / effects.&nbsp;






The rare and incredibly difficult-to-craft Brilliant Jewels also have a yellow icon rather than the standard aqua, to help distinguish them easily from the Luminous Jewels.&nbsp;






These visual and functional updates ensure that Jewels are being better represented in Earth 2 for upcoming and future plans for Jewels.&nbsp;



Players who are interested in participating in the Resources aspect of the EcoSim should begin familiarising themselves with the Jewels currently in their inventory and which Resources are associated with them. Exciting new updates coming soon will give Players a holistic view of their in-game assets, across their entire Player portfolio (not just per property) and help them keep track of their EcoSim assets.&nbsp;

Title: Resources Overview
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/07/23/resources-overview/

====================================================================================================
July 23, 2023 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211; Earth 2 has released a new update to help Players get an overview of how many Resources they have across their land portfolio.  This Resource Overview will summarise and display 5 Resource types from D1 (excluding Water, Wood and Sand which will be confirmed inside E2V1) then include future Resource types from D2 and upward as each of the new 21 Resource types are revealed.



To find out which Resources your properties have managed to detect so far simply:




Login to your Earth 2 Account;








Open your Profile; and









Select Resources








To see where other Players have discovered a particular Resource type simply:




Open the Map









Press on the &#8220;Map&#8221; button








Select &#8220;Heatmap&#8221; 








Select &#8220;Resources&#8221;








Select the Resource you want to see from the drop down menu








Zoom out to see a global view and Zoom in to see more granular location details 








This update is part of Earth 2&#8217;s goal to provide Players with a better overview of their various digital assets, which will include some interesting new statistics in the next overview release as we move into the next phase of the EcoSim.  Updates like the Resources Overview are being developed concurrently while other members of the Earth 2 team continue working on other larger upcoming features.  The Resources Overview page will continue to be updated and become an even more useful point of reference when Resource generation begins.



The Resources overview page in the Player profile is only visible to the owner of the properties, so make sure to login to check out how many Resources you currently have and the number of tiles they are distributed on!&nbsp;&nbsp;



RESOURCES OVERVIEW &#8211; MORE DETAILS



This new addition to the Player profile provides a comprehensive breakdown, not only of how many tiles in your portfolio are attributed with a particular Resources, but how many of those tiles belong to each Resource Frequency Category (currently displaying either HF or UF). So Players will be able to see exactly which Resources are discoverable on the land they own, and how many land tiles will be able to contribute to the output of Resource Occurrence Units for the overall Player account. 



Every time a Resource is released in Earth 2 and Players are able to successfully validate it via our E2PRV system, that Resource will appear on this page, along with details of the exact tiles attributed with that Resource. Those who do not get the Resource distributed on their property via E2PRV may have a Resource distributed on their property in the future, either via E2V1 (for sand, wood and water) or via direct game design distribution.&nbsp;



Having also recently released our updated Jewel inventory, Players are able to make a strategic decision on which Prime Jewels they may require more of. Below is a handy chart of which Jewels correspond to the Resources released to date. Hidden Resources and Jewels mean that the Resource has not yet been released and will instead be revealed in upcoming announcements whenever a new Resource is released.







Thank you for reading about these new additions to the Player profile page and be sure to keep an eye out for new updates via Earth 2 Socials!&nbsp;

Title: Resource Release: Zinc + Bauxite
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/07/27/resources-zinc-bauxite/

====================================================================================================
July 27, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 quietly released Bauxite and Zinc recently which are now officially available to claim via the Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) System. If you own property in Earth 2 and believe you have any of these Resources present in your land, submit a claim! You can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on your property if your claim is approved. 



These newly released Resources will also appear in the brand new Resources Overview tab on players’ profiles, as they become attributed to and discoverable on their properties (check out our announcement here).






Much like the real world, we want to design a platform where people will be inclined to trade with one another in order to obtain the raw materials they may be missing to create the Building Blocks they need, especially for some of the more advanced Building Blocks.&nbsp; And just like the real world, different people will secure access to different Resource types.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Therefore, as our EcoSim continues to expand and Raw Materials become tradable between Players on Earth 2, we’re excited about facilitating these Player-to-Player trades and the resultant diversification of&nbsp; Resource holdings between Players.



Raw Materials and Building Blocks will be tradable via the Bazaar and Players may sell their Raw Materials (and Building Blocks) for E$, and possibly sell or trade for other things in the future.  Remember though, trading will include a logistic aspect as well, meaning Players will need to transport their Raw Materials or Buildings blocks once purchased whether done by their own means or hiring others.Starting from Silver and Copper, each of the many new incoming Resource types will be open to claim and stake Essence via the E2PRV system.  Because most Players will not be receiving these new Resources automatically (unless they get lucky and own land close to another Player’s successful claim), the initial distribution of these new Resources are truly up for grabs for all Players, new or old, who have been or aim to be strategic with the location of their properties corresponding to real-world resource occurrences and who have put in the additional effort to secure these new resource types on their land via the E2PRV system. 



By being active and participating in the E2PRV system, these Players are potentially putting themselves in a good position to trade with other Players in the future who might have an abundance of other Resources but need other rarer Resources for higher tech tree items. We’d also like to remind Players that Raw Materials and Building Blocks are very important cornerstones of the EcoSim and will be part of what enables Players to create most things inside of Earth 2, so they are a big deal for almost anything being created or anything usable inside Earth 2!



You can find a few teaser details about the two latest released Resource types, Bauxite and Zinc including a little background on the Resource, what it’s often used for, the Jewel that primes the Resource, the Cydroid that can detect and collect its OUs, the land Tier required and some, not all, of the Building Blocks the Raw Materials replicated from the Resource contribute toward!



Resources Released: (as at 27 July, 2023)




BAUXITE (14 July, 2023)




The primary source of aluminium in the world, bauxite is used to create a metal that is light, strong, and resistant to corrosion. It is vital for modern transportation, packaging, and construction. Combined with other alloying metals, it can reach excellent yield strength and is suitable for light, high-speed crafts. Furthermore, due to its excellent conductivity, it is commonly found in electronic devices.







ZINC (14 July, 2023)




Primarily used in galvanising Iron to prevent rust reducing maintenance requirements efficiently. Indium, derived from Zinc, plays a crucial role in the electronics systems and the performance of vehicles.






We realise that this may be the first time Players have been able to lay eyes on some of the Building Block icons, so it is important to note that the above Building Blocks make up just a tiny fraction of the total number of Building Blocks we’ve actually designed to date.



Keep following to learn more about the EcoSim Building Blocks including new types, how to make them and what they will do. For now, take a look at the updated chart that shows the new Prime Jewels connected to the Resources released to date:

The above list of approved ores and minerals is also not a guarantee of approval, as valid evidence must still be provided and any other criteria for validation must also be met. Please remember that the guidelines set out by Earth 2 are designed to assist and safeguard Players who participate in the E2PRV system. Players should exclusively, carefully and precisely follow official Earth 2 guidelines to mitigate any loss of Essence or Assurance Fees due to submitting an invalid claim. Players who choose to ignore official guidelines do so at their own (and fellow staking Players’) risk.

Title: Profile Overview V1
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/07/28/profile-overview-v1/

====================================================================================================
July 28, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to announce the new Profile Overview V1 feature which forms part of our ongoing commitment to provide Players with a better overview of their various digital items.  This is a helpful update to the Profile page which allows Players to quickly gain valuable insight into the breakdown of their accumulated Earth 2 digital items and more. 



PROFILE OVERVIEW



The Earth 2 EcoSim, including various analytical features, will continue to expand as we lay the foundations for this complex, Player-driven ecosystem. With it, more and more utility-driven digital items will be released which we predict will have a compounding effect on the volume and complexity of building, utility and trade between Players. 



This latest update to the Player profile page will support a smoother transition into upcoming aspects of the EcoSim, and the expansion that comes with each subsequent release. Most importantly, this update will ensure Players always have access to a comprehensive overview of the current quantity and variety of the digital items they earn and own. This could also be seen as the first iteration (V1) of the Player Inventory Management system and having this information will allow Players to participate in the EcoSim confidently, armed with the freedom of choices empowered by knowledge. 



It is also important to note that the collection of trending data will start from the date of deployment, upon the release of the Overview page, and will include all future relevant data from this point in time onward.&nbsp;



While there are still hidden aspects of the EcoSim that will be revealed over time, the updated Profile page will allow Players to have a holistic understanding of their portfolio and digital items at their fingertips.&nbsp;



The Profile Overview V1 represents the beginning&nbsp; of the Player Inventory Management system and details the quantity and potential value of a Player’s current and available digital items.&nbsp; It can be found on the left-most tab, labelled “Overview” under the Player Profile page.







The Overview page includes an overview graph detailing the total E-ther claimed, total E-ther raided, and total Jewels claimed over the specified timeframe, across the Player’s entire portfolio of properties. Players can view the overview graph as either a bar graph:







Or a comparative line graph to track trends and see first hand how they are performing with various tasks:



The graph can also be adjusted to display the data depending on what you are wanting to see.&nbsp;



The Timeframe filter allows a Player to view an overview of their account based on the day, month, year or across all time:







The Data Frequency filter allows a Player to view an overview of their account at daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly intervals:







The second part of the Overview page is a breakdown of the Player’s total Available Assets, meaning the assets they currently own, and the collective market value/net worth of each asset type.







To reveal details about what each colour in the bar represents, simply hover over the bar:







In addition to how much Essence is currently in your Player balance, the asset overview will reveal how much Essence is currently held in Cydroid Power Cells (effectively Essence that is staked into the Earth 2 EcoSim). This is helpful to know as Power Cell Essence can be retrieved as needed, simply by depowering a Cydroid when fully charged.&nbsp;







SUMMARY OF THE OVERVIEW PAGE:




Players can see the total E-ther claim, E-ther raided and Jewels claimed across all their properties combined

Filter by timeframe



Filter by Data Frequency (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)



Change presentation visual (bar / line graph)





Players can see every single asset they own and the combined market value / net worth of that asset type

Tiles (Net Worth: E$)



Essence (Market Value: E$)



E-ther (Market Value: E$)



Jewels&nbsp; (Market Value: E$)



Cydroids (Market Value: E$)



Civilians (Market Value: E$)



Resources (Market Value: E$)



Occurrence Units (Market Value: E$) &#8211; Future Release



Raw Materials (Market Value: E$) &#8211; Future Release



Building Blocks (Market Value: E$) &#8211; Future Release






The current Player Asset overview is quite “simple” to begin with, but as more and more digital items are released and built, more granular statistics will become available for Players. This would include, for example, data per property and much more. This will allow for more in-depth analyses of account performance and empower Players to make better informed strategic decisions.

====================================================================================================
July 28, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; The prosperous days of fusing Red Energy to acquire new T1 land have come to an end for Earth 2 Pioneers.  The Civilians want Red Energy for themselves, for now.  



Therefore, at some time on Monday, the 31st of July UTC the ability to purchase new T1 Land using Red Energy will cease to exist with the likes possibly never to be seen again. It is possible that Red and the yet to be released Yellow Energy will have new utility though and likely be required as part of the process in future land upgrades, such as T2 to T1, but we are yet to learn more.



What we do know for now is that for active Players T1 and T2 land are the most secure way to acquire a stable supply of E-ther long term before any of the disinflationary mechanisms become activated.

Helpful E2PRV Information and Guidelines



An explanation of the E2PRV system is available to read here: https://earth2.io/news/e2prv-silver-copper&nbsp;&nbsp;



The most up to date guidelines on how to submit a valid E2PRV claim can be found in this article, under the Guidelines for Claim Submission heading: https://earth2.io/news/copper-silver-guidelines&nbsp;&nbsp;



Below is a useful table to help Players understand which ores/minerals (if any) will be accepted for a particular Resource:







*N.B. The CAT have provided a list of approved ores/minerals in order to assist Players in making a valid claim. However, Resource claim validation and Frequency Category attribution is always at the sole discretion of the Earth 2 CAT and there is no guarantee that ores/minerals not confirmed by Earth 2 will be approved. The above list of approved ores and minerals is also not a guarantee of approval, as valid evidence must still be provided and any other criteria for validation must also be met. Please remember that the guidelines set out by Earth 2 are designed to assist and safeguard Players who participate in the E2PRV system. Players should exclusively, carefully and precisely follow official Earth 2 guidelines to mitigate any loss of Essence or Assurance Fees due to submitting an invalid claim. Players who choose to ignore official guidelines do so at their own (and fellow staking Players’) risk.

Article 69
Title: REDUCED E2PRV REJECTION LOSS + GUIDELINE REMINDERS
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/08/08/e2prv-reduced-loss-and-guidelines/

====================================================================================================
August 08, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia- This is an important update to the E2PRV system that will affect all Players participating in submitting claims or staking Essence to claims. Continue reading to find out more about the reduction of Essence loss when claims are rejected, open claims that need to be re-assessed by Players as well as more examples of how our current guidelines apply to invalid claims commonly being submitted. 



Since the reduction of the Essence staking reward from 50% to 6.5%, along with the introduction of a staking lock timer to give stakers the time to review claim evidence, the Player backing portion of the E2PRV has been functioning well. We believe the improvement has been good enough for us to start testing a reduction of the Essence rejection loss from 100% to 20%.&nbsp;&nbsp;



If the overall quality of claims remains good and Players avoid staking weaker or invalid claims due to a perceived reduction of risk, then the rejection loss rate may remain at 20%.&nbsp; However, if there is an increase of Players staking bad claims (blind staking) then the rejection loss of 20% may be increased until we find the ideal level.



Players looking for which claim to stake their Essence to often use the backing % to give a clue as to the validity of a claim, as stronger claims tend to be backed to 100% much faster than the weaker ones. We’d like to point out that although this can be a strong indicator, it is not a fool-proof way of checking claims and Players should still review claims carefully before staking.&nbsp;



We’re certain that participants of the E2PRV system are extremely pleased to learn that we have updated the Essence percentage loss for new resource round claims (i.e. Copper and Silver release onwards) from 100% loss of staked Essence if a claim is rejected, down to just 20%. This is a significant update for Players participating in the system and offers a little more of a buffer to Players from claims that may appear to be valid but actually are not.&nbsp;



The Resource claims this reduction of staked Essence loss for Rejected claims applies explicitly to:




Copper;



Silver;



Zinc;



Tin;



Nickel;



Future release Resource until otherwise updated




This reduction also means the CAT will reject claims faster as opposed to letting them sit there for Players to re-evaluate, which brings us to an IMPORTANT REMINDER : In June, the CAT forewarned Players that if their new claim remained open for a long period of time and did not pass to “Under Investigation”, it was likely flagged for rejection.  Some Players adhered to this warning and cancelled those claims while others have ignored the warning and left their claims open.



Therefore, we are providing one final warning to both claim creators and stakers, if your claim has remained open for a long period of time and especially if the claim existed before the article released in June, then those claims are probably invalid.  We suggest claim creators review their claims and that stakers avoid staking Essence to those claims.  



At the time the guideline update was shared, the CAT confirmed that Players would be given a reasonable time to review such claims. It has since been over 6 weeks which we believe is more than a reasonable amount of time to be able to review any existing claims.  We will provide one more week for Players to re-assess the quality of their claims and look at cancelling such claims before processing rejections at the new 20% loss. Players should also review their “Open” claims which have not been updated to &#8220;Under Review&#8221; for a few weeks, as those too have most likely been flagged for rejection.



Guideline Reminders: Examples of Claims Currently Marked for Rejection&nbsp;



While the CAT has noticed a big improvement in the total number of invalid claims being submitted since sharing our updated guidelines, we are still receiving many claims that are, quite simply, invalid. A couple of the biggest reasons claims are marked as invalid are they do not match the exact coordinates of a resource occurrence, or do not have the correct resource present, or have neither the correct resource in the correct location. Both the location and the Resource must match up with the property location in Earth 2.&nbsp;



The following are examples of claims for Copper, Silver, Bauxite and Zinc which have been flagged for rejection due to being invalid and directly contradicting official guidelines previously shared (see the announcement here).&nbsp;



Example Bauxite claim



Claim ID: 100598



Player Backing: 100%&nbsp;



Resource: Bauxite



Evaluation Notes: Invalid evidence provided that does not prove the occurrence of Bauxite at the claim location:




Invalid / irrelevant link provided: https://www.mindat.org/locentry-1467630.html

&#8211; Pentlandite is not a relevant / valid mineral /ore of Bauxite (only Bauxite can be claimed for Bauxite)



&#8211; Badovac mine https://www.mindat.org/loc-62238.html&nbsp; is a lead-zinc mine and does not have any evidence of Bauxite.&nbsp;





No specific location provided: https://www.iris-bg.org/fls/intro.pdf

&#8211; Only 1 reference to Bauxite as a natural resource somewhere in the general area of 110 550 sq km





Claim property location is over 156 km away from the location provided via Mindat link for Badovac mine.&nbsp;



Invalid / irrelevant link to pdf document provided&nbsp; https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2016/rncan-nrcan/M42-280-8-eng.pdf

&#8211; Only 1 reference to Bauxite in bibliography, and irrelevant to occurrence of bauxite at this property location.&nbsp;





This claim does not satisfy the criteria set out by Earth 2:&nbsp;
















Example Silver claim



Claim ID: 99267



Player Backing: 100%



Resource: Silver



Evaluation Notes: The claimant’s property is located over 25 kms away from the evidence provided:




Legitimate mine and resource proof provided via link ( https://www.mindat.org/loc-158703.html ). HOWEVER, the provided mine does not correspond to the Player’s actual property.&nbsp;



The referenced Tungaoling deposit is situated almost 20 kms away.



The MRDATA USGS link ( https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/show-mrds.php?dep_id=10069692 ) is not credible (category E rating) on its own as it does not have any bibliographic references to corroborate the information and should have supplementary evidence provided. Coordinates provided are also over 18 kms from the claimant’s property location.



Pdf attachment provided includes screenshots of locations referenced in the above links and are irrelevant to the property location. Also includes screenshots of Copper minerals / ores which are valid supplementary evidence but cannot be accepted due to irrelevance of location.&nbsp;



This claim does not satisfy the criteria set out be Earth 2:












Example Zinc claim



Claim ID: 104710



Player Backing: 3%



Resource: Zinc&nbsp;



Evaluation Notes: The claim description makes broad statements about natural resources in Las Vegas but does not provide any evidence to actually support this claim:




The Mindat link provided for Frenchman mine (https://www.mindat.org/loc-61530.html) does not reference Zinc and is located 15 kms away from the claimant’s property



The Mindat link provided for Clark County (https://www.mindat.org/loc-14764.html) is irrelevant as it is not a valid area (too large) for Resource validation and also does not provide any supplementary evidence to categorically support the widespread occurrence of Zinc in this area.&nbsp;



When Zinc is selected from the exploitable commodities list in the above Mindat link, the closest occurrence location is Three Kids deposit (https://www.mindat.org/loc-61494.html) and is over 31 kms away.&nbsp;



The attached image showing Zinc in the commodity list is supplementary evidence and cannot be accepted without other sources that verify the location of the property corresponds to the Resource location.&nbsp;



This claim does not satisfy the criteria set out be Earth 2:












Example Copper claim



Claim ID: 104355



Player Backing: 20%



Resource: Copper



Evaluation Notes: Although claimant’s property is located within Al-Jizah (Giza) city:




The location is not specific enough, nor does it provide sufficient evidence to support the presence of a Resource being abundant throughout this entire city;



The exact coordinates of the Mindat link are 5.8 kms away from the claimant’s property;



The resource listed in the mineral list (Sampleite) is not copper, and is not an accepted ore/mineral of copper (the resource being claimed);



The exact occurrence location of sampleite (provided in the Mindat link) is 21.12km away from the claimant’s property location (in addition to point 3).&nbsp;



This claim does not satisfy the criteria set out by Earth 2:












As you can see from the above examples, sometimes claims that have high player backing are still invalid and stakers should not rely on high backing percentages as a sign of a valid claim. Rather, they should exercise due diligence and check the evidence provided and the claim location before staking any Essence to a claim.&nbsp;



The E2PRV system was a new system and as such is subject to refinement and quality assurance checks for claim evaluation procedures. However, Earth 2 has shared clear guidelines for valid claims to support Players whilst upholding the primary purpose of the E2PRV system which was originally created to distribute Resources to Player-owned properties that have those Resources present in the real world. The current claim evaluation procedure is robust and fair. It is only claims that are attempting to claim Resources in locations where the Resource does not exist, or Resources which are not accepted, or even released, by Earth 2 that are being flagged for rejection. 



We cannot stress enough that Players are responsible for following&nbsp;the official guidelines shared by Earth 2 when submitting an E2PRV claim. We cannot and will not be responsible for claims that are submitted with complete disregard for the latest guidelines we have shared, that were designed to ensure Players have the best chance of a successful claim.&nbsp;Luckily most Players are now getting this right most of the time.&nbsp;



To reiterate on what was mentioned earlier in this article and to provide a clear warning, we have&nbsp; noticed many &#8220;Open&#8221; status copper and silver claims submitted prior to the 24th of June, 2023&nbsp; have not yet been removed. These claims were flagged for rejection but purposefully left as &#8220;Open&#8221; status to allow Players to remove their invalid claims and regain any assurance fee and staked Essence. Any claims that were submitted prior to the 24th of June but are still &#8220;Open&#8221; status should be removed so as not to be processed as &#8220;Rejected&#8221; and lose the associated assurance fee and Essence.&nbsp;



Overall, the CAT will continue to be as lenient as possible. However, the level of leniency is always at the discretion of the CAT and depends on many dynamic factors. Therefore Players are still advised to closely follow the guidelines Earth 2 has shared to protect themselves from potential claim rejection, and not rely on or attempt to predict the margin of leniency the CAT will be practising.

Title: Brilliant Ability Revealed &#8211; the &#8216;COPY EFFECT&#8217;
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/08/10/brilliant-copy/

====================================================================================================
August 10, 2023 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211; A Brilliant Jewel is a rare type of Jewel that has an extremely small chance of being created when crafting Luminous Jewels in Earth 2.&nbsp; They are often sold on the secondary market between Players for exuberant figures, but it is important to remember that these prices are completely Player driven, Earth 2 does not set prices for any Jewels sold via the Bazaar.



The secrets of the Brilliant jewels are still yet to be fully discovered but today we can reveal more details surrounding one of their mysteries, as well as confirming some special boosts to their current ability.&nbsp;



It is worth noting that most Jewels tend to have a variety of different utility, whether being used in the EcoSim, or to boost a Cydroid and many other uses yet to be revealed making them extremely versatile.&nbsp; Brilliants are still Jewels and as with any Jewel, what you get out of a Brilliant will often be different depending on how or where you are using it.



As Players are already familiar with, one of the Brilliant jewel’s effects grant the power to increase the performance of a slotted object where small margins may make all the difference such as giving a considerable edge to the yield of Resources or in the future could even play an important role in turning the tide of a &#8220;battle&#8221; or help with a timely escape.&nbsp;



Enter, the COPY Effect.



The Brilliant&#8217;s COPY boost effect will first be available when slotted into Cydroids, with the COPY effect to be made available for Mentars and other objects in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;



How It Works



The way the Brilliant jewel’s COPY effect works is quite simple yet powerful, if done correctly. Any Brilliant jewel may amplify its own available boost effect(s) by multiplying the total boost effect of the other slotted jewels by the Brilliant’s COPY effect percentage.



Example: (Please refer to our announcement image as a visual reference)




In this example the player slots one of each quality from Cracked-Luminous.&nbsp; The choice to slot 5 of the same Jewel is merely to demonstrate that any regular quality jewels can be used, except for Brilliants.&nbsp;



1 of each T3 Ochre (Cracked, Cloudy, Common, Clear, Luminous) granting a total diminished slotted effect of 9.06% production boost for Iron ore





The Player then adds 1x T3 Ochre (BRILLIANT) jewel resulting in a 75% COPY Effect.



9.06 % * 0.75 = 6.8% which is then added on top (stacked) to the total effect = 9.06% +6.8% = 15.86% Iron ore boost.




Additional Example:




If e.g. a T3 Amber, boosting Iron ore &amp; Gold, then this Iron Ore boost would also have been included in the total COPY Effect.&nbsp;



Furthermore, if the player slotted a T3 Amber (BRILLIANT) then this jewel would have amplified both Gold and Iron Ore boost from slotted jewels. E.g. if the player slotted both Yellow jewels and Ochre Jewels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




NOTE: The Amber jewel also boosts GOLD but this boost is not COPIED by the Ochre Brilliant jewel as it does not carry that boost. However, if an Amber Brilliant was slotted instead both the Iron ore and the Gold boosts would be copied!



The Tier of the Brilliant will also grant different levels of the COPY effect. Ranging from 25% to 75%. Slotting 2 Brilliants of the same color will enhance the COPY effect but at a diminished compound rate. This means that slotting more Brilliants will always have more COPY effect than just one Brilliant but each time another Brilliant is slotted, the individual COPY effect is reduced, although it is still possible to achieve a Copy effect of almost 100% essentially doubling the standard slotted effect!!



The Brilliants slotted effect will not only COPY Resource boosts, but also performance boost recently introduced for Cydroids, as well as E-ther boosts and more.



Perfect Combo COPY &#8211; RBA (Reward, Badges &amp; Achievements)



Slotting the most optimal combination of jewels to achieve the highest total boost effect for the Brilliant&#8217;s COPY Effect to further multiply the boosts is something to strive for.&nbsp; In the future we are considering adding various optimized combos to the library of RBAs (Reward, Badges &amp; Achievements). When a player discovers and unlocks an optimal combo it is theorised that it makes the Jewels resonate in a special frequency. Some say they have even heard it and refer to it as the jewels &#8220;singing&#8221;. When a Brilliant jewel is added to an RBA Combo it will further unlock a hidden power. When more is known it will be revealed in a future announcement.



The #1 Rule:



A Brilliant cannot copy the effect of another Brilliant. I.e. In the case of slotting ONLY 2 Blue Brilliants, without giving them any other jewels to copy the boost effects from, they will not activate their COPY effect, rather they will give their own regular boost effect, acting as regular jewels. So remember to slot your brilliants wisely!



In the future, other benefits may be revealed when slotting multiple Brilliants of the same or different colours.



One more Groundbreaking Revelation about the future of Brilliants &#8211; Tethering &amp; Co-op COPY effect / Multi-object COPY Effect



We have now covered how the Brilliants COPY effect will work when slotted into a single object such as the Mentar, Cydroids and so on but over time it is likely that the power will be able to extend beyond the host itself!&nbsp;



Slotting Brilliants into special objects with tethering capabilities (E.g. the Mentar which Cydroids are tethered to) will distribute the boost via the tether signal, amplifying a full or partial boost effect to the objects tethered to it. Making the Mentar, for example, a central beacon for boosts which could even pass through to other Mentars!



Furthermore, there will be consideration as the tethering functionality expands in Earth 2, the amplified copy effects may not only encompass a Player’s own tethered objects but extend these effects to other players’ objects in a collaborative setting, such as being in the same Territory (like a Megacity) or Guild. These enhancements are still under review and further details will be released and further elaborated on in the future.



Immediate Increase to E-ther Evaporation for all Brilliants



In addition to the incoming COPY effect for Cydroid slotting, we are also excited to confirm Brilliants will receive an important boost when slotted on the Mentar.&nbsp; Previously, Brilliant Jewels would give a 1% to 3% boost to E-ther evaporation depending on the Tier level.&nbsp; When the next updates go live, this boost will increase to between 10% to 23% depending on the Tier level!&nbsp;







A Quick Summary:




A Brilliant can copy several different boost types at the same time



It can only copy non-brilliant quality effects.




Future COPY Effect Features on the Drawing Board:




RBA / Singing Effect &#8211; If a perfect combo is achieved with regular jewels, an RBA (Reward Badges &amp; Achievement) can be unlocked, further increasing the Brilliant&#8217;s COPY effect as the Jewels are resonating in perfect frequency making them &#8220;sing&#8221; as lore is told.



Multiple Brilliants Effect

&#8211; Slotting multiple Brilliants (same or different colour) may unlock further power.







Distributed / Tethered COPY Effect

&#8211; In the future the Brilliant jewels can also copy and boost several objects at the same time through the tethering connection





Distributed Territorial &amp; Guild COPY Effect

&#8211; Allows the Brilliant&#8217;s to COPY and boost several objects that may not be owned by the Brilliant owner when engaging in various Co-op activities.



&#8211; NOTE: The COPY effect through Tethering, Territorial &amp; Guild may vary.





The Mentar and the COPY effect

&#8211; The COPY Effect will be implemented on Mentar Jewel Slotting boosts in the future



&#8211; The Brilliant&#8217;s effect will also be fully detailed there in the future. 






The COPY effect is vast and powerful but there may yet be other secrets of the Brilliant jewel to uncover in the future.

Title: NEW JEWEL BOOST OVERVIEW FOR RESOURCES
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/08/11/resource-jewel-boost-overview/

====================================================================================================
August 11, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; With all the excitement around our recent ‘yet to be officially announced’ feature, we wanted to first publish a short article pointing out a small but useful update to the Property Jewel Slotting page.



This update provides a nice overview summarising the boosts of multiple Jewels slotted into a Mentar on a property.  To view this overview, simply look for the new icon located on the right side of the Property card on the Jewel slotting page (Right Menu &gt; Resources &gt; Slotting).







Players will now have a clearer view of overall expected performance based on the boosts achieved when multiple Jewels are slotted.&nbsp; In the near future we intend to improve this overview by identifying Jewels which are actively priming a Resource as well.







We invite Players to try different Jewel combinations to get the most out of the precious Jewel slots their properties have available, achieving optimal results from the Jewels used!

====================================================================================================
August 11, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Tungsten is now available to claim via the Earth 2 Player Resource Validation (E2PRV) System! This is a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have this (or any currently released) Resources present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.



IMPORTANT : Tungsten has only just been released at 9:30pm Friday evening Australian East Coast time. The first approvals from the CAT will likely not occur until next week, therefore, confirmed Tungsten locations will not appear on the heatmap until such time.  Only the Claim locations will appear on the heatmap.



If you missed it, you can check out the announcement about the Resources Overview release here.&nbsp;

Title: Cydroid Management Update &amp; Cydroid Slotting
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/08/17/cydroid-jewel-slotting/

====================================================================================================
August 17, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; We are very pleased to announce that the Cydroid Management interface released last week is officially live! Many Players have already started exploring the new features as soon as they discovered the quiet release. Similar to the Civilian Management section, Players can now see a complete overview of all their Cydroids which includes the ability to view them by individual Cydroids or by the properties they are currently tethered on.&nbsp; But more importantly, this update introduces a major new utility for one of Earth 2’s core digital items, Jewels, via the release of the Cydroid slotting system!



Cydroid Jewel Slotting goes Live!



Jewels are randomly spawned on land owned by Earth 2 Players and can be used as is or crafted (burned) into higher tiers and qualities, or entirely different types of Jewels by using different combination recipes.&nbsp; They can also be slotted into Mentars to improve various EcoSim related elements such as improved E-ther detection, improved E-ther evaporation, boosted Resource production and now boost specifications on Cydroids!



By slotting specific Jewels into your Cydroid you can improve a magnitude of its abilities such as Raid Range, Speed, E-ther Dispensing Time, Power Cell Efficiency, Power Concentration Level, Relocation Range and E-ther storage.



Jewels also have 6 different quality levels and each quality level provides adjusted improvements to all of the above Cydroid abilities resulting in a complex system involving a variety of Jewel combinations which open up a bunch of new strategies for Players.&nbsp;&nbsp;




“This is an exciting update that demonstrates improvements in our team&#8217;s ability to design, develop and release new game mechanics which sync nicely with existing game loops and operate real time on a global scale.” 
-Shane Isaac, Founder of Earth 2




“Right now Players can use and experience this new system on our website but in the future these Cydroid boosts might also be important when you need that little more speed or longer lasting energy inside E2V1.”




Since being quietly released last week, the new utility for Jewels and the demand to slot Cydroids has resulted in over 3,000,000 Jewels being burned while crafting new higher tier Jewels that can be slotted into Cydroids. Earth 2 has plans to add even further utility to Jewels over time.



Cydroid Management Overview



Players can access Cydroid Management under the same Raid Management page where Civilian Management is already located.






If you have no Cydroids, you can build Cydroids up to the maximum number based on the size of your property:







TIP: Strategic play is key and we recommend assessing your property location, size and neighbours before selecting which property/ies to build your Cydroids.&nbsp;



Once built, Cydroids can raid other Player’s properties for unstable E-ther. They can also be relocated to another property owned by the same Player. This latest release of Jewel Slotting in the Cydroid Management interface provides even more options for Players in terms of raiding and strategy and many Players are already realising just how lucrative raiding can be from correctly slotting Jewels into their Cydroids.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Manage by Property



Within the Cydroid Management Interface, Cydroids can be viewed and managed based on the property they are tethered to. This is useful when looking to:




Improve the performance of a property (location-based)



Relocate a Cydroid&nbsp;



Check how many Cydroids are currently tethered to each property



Check how many tethered Cydroids are currently Powered/De-Powered on each property&nbsp;




The Property “Sort By” options allow you to sort your properties by order of Name (alphabetical), Location (alphabetical), Tile size or Cydroids (number of Cydroids tethered).&nbsp;



Manage by Cydroids



The Cydroid Management interface also allows Players to view and manage their Cydroids individually. This is useful when looking to:




Improve the performance of an individual Cydroid



Improve Cydroids based on their rarity (e.g. Legendary)



Improve Cydroids based on their location (e.g. not a specific property, but the same MegaCity)



Improve Cydroids based on current Efficiency %




The Cydroid “Sort By” options allow you to sort your Cydroids by order of Name (alphabetical), Storage (E-ther), Speed (max. travel speed), Charge (Power Cell %), Efficiency (%), Jewels (number of Jewels slotted) or Location (alphabetical).&nbsp;



Cydroid Info&nbsp;



When a Cydroid is selected within the Cydroid Management interface, a complete overview of the Cydroid’s basic details and current technical specs are displayed on the right-hand side panel.&nbsp;






The Cydroid’s past raid stats will also be recorded here (to be released).






These raid stats will be released and expanded on in the future release of the Insights interface which can be seen under the Raid Management page navigations. Although not yet released, it will assist Players in their analysis of raids and subsequent strategy.&nbsp;



For now, Players can also quickly Power and DePower their Cydroids from this panel. This is also where Players will be able to sell their Cydroids on the Bazaar (to be released). A teaser button is shown and will be accessible whether managing by properties or by individual Cydroids.&nbsp;






Cydroid Slotting



Included in the release of Cydroid Management is the Cydroid Slotting feature which allows Players to slot particular Jewels into their Cydroids to boost the base level specs detailed above.&nbsp;



To boost a Cydroid, Players can either select the Jewel Slotting button within the Cydroid Info panel, or select the Cydroid Boosts tab as shown below:






Slotting Jewels to improve Cydroids will involve experimentation and strategy, as each Cydroid’s boost requirements will differ depending on the location and what you want to achieve.&nbsp;



Different Jewels and Jewel combinations will have different effects on a Cydroid’s raid specs, so the &#8220;Results&#8221; box will be useful for Players to test different Jewels and Jewel combinations in their Cydroid’s slots.&nbsp;






Note: Only Jewels with boosts relevant to Cydroids will appear in the Jewel Inventory for Cydroid Slotting. To see all your Jewels, visit the Jewel Inventory on the Resources page, or the Asset Overview in your Player Profile page.&nbsp;



Here is a helpful list of all the Jewels that can be slotted into a Cydroid, and their respective (maximum possible) boost effects: 







Since the complete update to the Jewel icons and inventory UI, Players are also able to slot stacks of the same Jewel kind into a Cydroid and the Jewel with the best (highest) boost effect from that stack will automatically be selected and slotted into the Cydroid’s empty slot.&nbsp;



Many Players have been waiting for the ability to boost their Cydroids, so what are you all waiting for? Check out the new Cydroid Management interface, and start boosting your active Cydroids to optimise their raid results!







Helpful Q+A




Does it cost money or Jewels to slot my Cydroids?

A: Slotting Cydroids works like slotting Properties (Mentars) &#8211; the Jewels are only effective whilst slotted into Cydroids and can be unslotted and returned to your Jewel Inventory. Slotting Jewels does not cost any money or Essence and these Jewels can be retrieved from the slots. However, unslotting can only be done when the Jewel is not locked into a Cydroid slot &#8211; which leads to the next question.&nbsp;





How does locking/unlocking work?

A: &#8220;Locking&#8221; occurs automatically when a Jewel is slotted into a Cydroid and that Cydroid begins an action which utilises the Jewel&#8217;s boost effect. When a Jewel is &#8220;locked&#8221; it means the Cydroid is actively using the Jewel (e.g. Catseye Jewel is locked while it increases the maximum speed of a Cydroid travelling to a raid). When a Jewel is &#8220;locked&#8221;, it cannot be removed from the Cydroid’s slot until the affected action is completed or ceased.&nbsp;



A: &#8220;Unlocking&#8221; occurs automatically when the Cydroid has completed the action it was undertaking, which was using the boost effects of the slotted Jewel. When a Jewel is unlocked from the Cydroid&#8217;s slot, it may be unslotted from the Cydroid. It is worth noting that if the Jewel affects the Cydroid’s Power Cell then the Cydroid needs to be depowered in order for the Jewel to be unlocked and will not become active until the Cydroid is powered again.





What happens when I sell/buy a property with CDs and slotted jewels?

A: As soon as you sell a property, all Jewels slotted in Cydroids tethered to that property will be unslotted. The jewels will return to the inventory of the original owner of the property. The buyer will then receive all the Cydroids tethered to the property, but not the jewels that were slotted in them. This prevents Players from potentially losing any jewels they forgot were slotted in their Cydroids.&nbsp;





What the heck do the energy jewels do?





A: PREHNITE (Energy Concentration)




Prehnite increases&nbsp; the Power Cell Essence Concentration Level (PCL). Power Cells can later be crafted with various default Power Concentration Levels. The higher the Power Cell Concentration level is, the more Energy Units and the more Essence is required. However, Prehnite is able to increase the Concentration Level of a Power Cell without requiring the Player to add additional Essence to power the higher grade Power Cell.&nbsp;




A: SUNSTONE (Power Efficiency)




As opposed to Prehnite which increases the concentration level, Sunstone increases the Energy efficiency which also lets Players enjoy more output from their Power Cells. In a do- more-with-less-energy kind of fashion it is similar to the Prehnite (which increases the Energy Units instead) but slotted together, they can be an interesting combination. Since Sunstone increases energy efficiency it means that less energy units are required per activity whilst keeping the same total Energy Unit capacity.




When will Cydroids get more slots?

A: In the future Cydroids will enjoy various types of upgrades, including the Prospecting upgrade. This upgrade will introduce dedicated slots for Resources and is scheduled to be the next type of Jewel slots Players will see on their Cydroids.&nbsp;






Other types of upgrades and &#8211; quite possibly -ways to acquire non-ethereal Cydroids will later come into play which may also impact Resource slots.&nbsp;

Title: P2P Cydroid Trading NOW LIVE
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/08/28/cydroid-bazaar/

====================================================================================================
August 28, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211;&nbsp; Earth 2 is pleased to officially announce P2P Cydroid trading which is now LIVE on the Bazaar! Cydroids being sold via the Bazaar come fully powered with 5 Essence so they are locked, loaded and ready to raid!&nbsp;&nbsp;



This is a great opportunity to trade their Cydroids for E$ (E$1=$1USD) or for new, existing or future Players, who lack enough Essence to build their first Cydroid, to get started and try their hand in raiding with Cydroids currently selling for between $0.60 to $12.00 each depending on rarity and other factors (note that prices will fluctuate as it is a 100% Player driven market, Earth 2 does not set any prices).



Remember, these first edition Cydroids have more utility than just raiding alone, with many also possessing the ability to act as Prospecting Cydroids (to increase Resource Occurrence Unit gathering vs Mentar alone) plus other abilities which have not yet been disclosed.



The Cydroid Bazaar is an extension to Earth 2’s player-to-player trading system and is a significant update towards our goal of providing Players with control over the digital items they own in a completely Player-driven economy.  Prices may fluctuate as different utilities for Cydroids are announced over time. But for now, keep reading for more details!&nbsp;



(Hey there, if you don’t know what a Cydroid is, we recommend you watch this video about Cydroids and Raiding before continuing with this article).&nbsp;



The Bazaar: Cydroid Trading&nbsp;







The Bazaar has been moved from its previous location within the Resources section of the Player menu to make it easier for everyone to find.&nbsp; Cydroid Trading is now LIVE and can be found by going to Marketplace &gt; Bazaar &gt; Cydroids.&nbsp;



The Bazaar is the trading hub for Player-built and owned digital items. As more components of the EcoSim are released and external prices on core digital commodities such as Essence are determined, we predict there will be a direct increase in the demand for and trading of related EcoSim assets. The player-to-player trading of Jewels (which contain boosts and benefits related to Resources and Raiding) and Holobuildings (which have the ability to store Resource Occurrence Units for Resource production) is already facilitated on the Bazaar. Adding Cydroid trading to this existing system provides more opportunities for Players to not only gain digital items they may require, but in some cases also earn from these digital items.&nbsp;



The beauty of a Player-driven trading system, such as the Bazaar, is that every Player participating in this system is gaining something in the transaction, whether by gaining an item they need, or gaining E$ from items they wish to sell.&nbsp;



Cydroid Trading Details



There are a multitude of reasons why a Player may choose to sell their Cydroid, and there are equally as many reasons why a Player may be looking to buy a Cydroid from another Player. The fundamental concept of Cydroids is that they are not only an important digital items  (currently the core mechanic of Raiding) each Cydroid will have increasingly more utility, and become  a collectable that is adaptive to the expansion of its utility as the EcoSim grows. This ensures Cydroids aren’t only useful and relevant now, but may continue to be even more so as different components of the EcoSim are released. 



When a Cydroid build is in progress, their rarity is not known until they are fully built. Some Players may be collecting all existing Cydroids released in Earth 2 to date. Others may be building their collection of the rarest, Legendary Cydroids only. Building Cydroids also requires an initial injection of Essence which some Players may not have the Essence balance to do. Such Players may benefit immensely from the ability to purchase directly off the Bazaar as this skips the sometimes time consuming journey to get those first few Essence on their part. The newly acquired Cydroid can try raiding unstable E-ther which (if successfully raided) can then be transformed into Essence to grow their Essence balance, as many Players have already managed to do.&nbsp;



All the details required for Players to purchase the exact Cydroid they are looking for are provided on each Bazaar listing.&nbsp;







Each Cydroid listing on the Bazaar will display the unique details about that Cydroid, such as:




The current owner/seller



The Rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary)



The Cydroid Type (e.g. CD001)



The Cydroid’s name (set by the current owner)



The Cydroid function(s) / abilities



The listed price



Whether the Cydroid includes a Power Cell (contains Essence), and



The current tethered location




The back of the Cydroid listing card also reveals details of the Cydroid’s unique specifications:




Power Cell Sockets



Power Cell Size



Relocation Range



Raid Range



Storage Bay



Speed, and



Jewel Slots for Cydroid boosting&nbsp;




Most of these specs will be the same for all Cydroids, but once nested items can be sold (a future feature allowing Cydroids to be sold whilst slotted with Jewels), these specs will be different and Players will want to search carefully for the Cydroid with very specific abilities obtained by using Jewels boosts.&nbsp;



Logistics of Cydroid Trading



TELEPORTATION



Currently, Cydroids traded on the Bazaar will be transferred using the temporary method of teleportation, to allow players to trade more freely. This method currently ignores relocation requirements that will be introduced with future methods, but still requires a fully charged power cell to be in the Cydroid.&nbsp;



RELOCATE (future feature)



Autonomous assets, such as Cydroids, will be able to relocate without other logistical aids. However, they still need to be traded with a fully charged (100%) power cell… or potentially a walking civilian.&nbsp;



Listing a Cydroid on the Bazaar



Listing a Cydroid for sale on the Bazaar is easy. The only requirements for listing a Cydroid is that the Cydroid:




Must have a fully charged power cell (100%),&nbsp;



Must be Idle, and



Must not have any E-ther in its storage (if there is E-ther, the E-ther must be dispensed before listing)




Once all of the above requirements are met, select the desired Cydroid from your Cydroid Management interface:







From there, you can find the option to sell your Cydroid at the bottom of the Cydroid Info panel, as so:







Next, select your logistics (transfer) option. Only the teleportation option is available for now ( detailed above).







Then enter your desired selling price:&nbsp;







Once you have confirmed the selling price, your Cydroid will be listed on the Bazaar. As a quick overview of which of your Cydroids are currently listed on the Bazaar, you can take a look at the left-hand-side management panel (Cydroids will be marked as “For Sale”):







A few important things to note when listing a Cydroid on the Bazaar is that this action will affect your ability to use the Cydroid whilst it is listed for sale. While your Cydroid is for sale:




It cannot be sent on any raids,&nbsp;



It cannot be relocated to a different property,



It cannot be depowered,



Any Jewels that were slotted into the available Cydroid slots will remain in the Cydroid unless manually removed, and at this point in time will automatically be removed upon the final sale of the Cydroid.




As the above restrictions are applied, Cydroids cannot be in the middle of relocating or raiding, or be depowered when attempting to list the Cydroid on the Bazaar as the sell function will be disabled.&nbsp;



Delisting a Cydroid



Once a Cydroid has been listed on the Bazaar, it can be removed from the Bazaar by its owner. Delisting is simple and the option is available in the same location, having replaced the Sell Cydroid option in the Cydroid Info panel.&nbsp;







Simply confirm that you wish to proceed with delisting a Cydroid and the Cydroid will be removed from the Bazaar.







Buying a Cydroid



To purchase a Cydroid, go to Marketplace -&gt; Bazaar -&gt; Cydroids to see all Cydroids currently listed for sale.&nbsp;



You can filter the results by Cydroid Rarity or Type, and sort the results by order of Price or Rarity.&nbsp;







Cydroids can be purchased individually by selecting the BUY NOW button:







To finalise the purchase, select the designated property that will tether your new Cydroid.&nbsp;







You also have the option to add Cydroids to your “cart” and buy multiple Cydroids in a single transaction. When more than one Cydroid is selected, a BUY SELECTED button will appear at the top of the Cydroid Bazaar:







When purchasing multiple Cydroids, each selected Cydroid can be designated to a different property with an available tether spot.&nbsp;







When attempting to purchase Cydroids from the Bazaar, you must ensure that you have an eligible property for the purchased Cydroid/s to tether to. If you don’t own any properties, you can purchase one from the map (BUY LAND) or the Marketplace. If you own properties but there are no tether spots available, you can sell the Cydroid/s you no longer want / need in order to purchase a new Cydroid.&nbsp;



NB: Anyone with a free Earth 2 account is able to buy Cydroids from the Bazaar. However, you must have the KYC check completed on your Earth 2 account if you want to SELL on the Bazaar. This protects all parties involved in the transaction and ensures the utmost safety and security for all Players.&nbsp;



Overall, Cydroid trading allows Players to potentially earn from digital items which might otherwise go unused on their current properties, or to obtain digital items they need quickly, particularly when wanting to bypass build times etc. by purchasing pre-built Cydroids.&nbsp;

Title: Jewel Bazaar Update, Jewels Bulk Buy &amp; New Marketplace Filter
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/09/05/jewel-bazaar-update/

====================================================================================================
September 5, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Following the recent release of P2P Cydroid trading on the Bazaar, the new-look Jewel Bazaar UI has also been updated to not only bring it in line with the new design style on Earth 2 but to facilitate a better experience for Players overall. 







In addition to their existing purpose, the recent increased utility of Jewels through Cydroid slotting, which boosts effects on Cydroids and their raiding specs, the revelation of new priming Jewels for newly released Resource types and the potential of other use-cases in the future, such as fusing Jewels with Cydroids, slotting them on your Avatar and more, Jewel trading is quickly becoming a staple in many Players’ Earth 2 repertoire.&nbsp;&nbsp;



The Jewel Bazaar update includes a complete upgrade to our signature dark theme but notably Players are now able to make bulk purchases of Jewels listed on the Bazaar using the quick selection checkbox on the top left-hand corner of each listing. Conveniently, by clicking the new ‘Select All’ button, Players will be able to select all items that are displayed on the current page.



If you haven’t recently visited the Bazaar, it is now located in an easier to find location within the Marketplace.







Cydroid Bulk Buy Update







When bulk purchasing Cydroids from the Bazaar, Players are required to assign destination properties for each Cydroid. To improve the assigning experience of bulk-purchase Cydroids to multiple properties, the newly updated UI clearly shows which properties have already been selected as destinations for the Cydroids being purchased in the bulk-buy.&nbsp;



The green number preceded by a ‘+’ symbol indicates the number of Cydroids already selected for teleportation to the property (see image above). When the number of Cydroids selected for teleportation to a particular property reaches the maximum tether space on that property, the property will remain visible in the list but will no longer be selectable.&nbsp;



This update addresses a previous issue where&nbsp; Players were unknowingly assigning multiple Cydroids to the same property beyond the property’s maximum tethering capacity thereby causing the bulk-buy to fail.



Marketplace Filter Update



A new filter was also added to the Earth 2 Property Marketplace allowing Players to search for the exact property size they wish to purchase.&nbsp; The new&nbsp; “Filter by Land Size” option allows Players to search for the exact property size they are after, simply by keying in an exact size, or a range of sizes, for example, 10-50, which will display all properties for sale between a range of 10 to 50 tiles.



A revamped version of the Marketplace is currently in the works, with the aim&nbsp; to bring the Marketplace up to speed with the recent flurry of feature releases on Earth 2, such as displaying Resource Types, Cydroids Tethered, Jewels Slotted, and more.&nbsp; These are bigger upgrades than it sounds due to a number of not so obvious edge cases. One very important requirement being the locking of digital items on a property when that property is for sale, essentially protecting the buyer by guaranteeing what they see will in fact be what they receive in the final sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Our team is well and truly capable of such updates, but with limited bandwidth and a list of higher priority items in development and the end of the year quickly approaching, our team also has other features we need to prioritise.&nbsp; We thank you for your patience and continued support. We will continue to release smaller filter updates to improve your experience when and where possible until such time we are able to implement the revamped version in the future.

Title: P2P Civilian Trading LIVE 
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/09/19/civilian-bazaar-live/

====================================================================================================
September 19, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2® is pleased to officially announce P2P Civilian trading which is now LIVE on the Bazaar! Civilians become the third major tradeable EcoSim utility item on the Bazaar and the unique aesthetic and skills that come with their achieved mastery levels make each of these First Edition Civilians useful in their own specific way. 




“The Civilian addition to the Bazaar aligns with our long term goal of creating a Metaverse with a vibrant EcoSim that facilitates trade between Players who discover, build, train, improve, find, manufacture, and craft many of the digital items inside of Earth 2,” said Earth 2 Founder, Shane Isaac. 





“We also realise it takes time for a small Player to collect the 25 E-ther required to synthesise their first and then each subsequent Civilian, so those smaller Players of not only today but also tomorrow, who manage to achieve a level of success via manual raiding, now have the additional option of acquiring Civilians from other Players starting from a few cents for a Level 1.”





“Initiatives such as the Civilian, Cydroid &amp; Jewel Bazaar form part of our ideology to include the Player in the ecosystem of digital item acquisition on our platform as opposed to excluding the Player like many traditional game platforms,” Shane went on to say. “To paint a clearer picture, nowadays many games, especially on mobile, solely provide options for the Player to purchase a digital item directly from the game company without the ability to resell or generate tradable items which is of course perfect for the game company. On Earth 2 we provide the ability for the Player to create such items or resources and we strive to go that step further to ensure the Player not only has the ability to sell or resell the item but receives the majority of the sale price. It’s still a work in progress and coming together but it has been very rewarding to see it functioning so far and we’ve experienced higher trade volumes than expected.”




In P2P trading, some Players may use the Civilian Bazaar to collect First Edition Civilians in sets from each available Faction, while others may focus on purchasing a Civilian solely for their occupational skills and mastery levels. But as usual, Players have already identified a number of additional strategies in relation to Civilian management and while Earth 2 did not expect the popularity of Civilian trading on the Bazaar to grow until well into the future, we have already seen over 17,000 Civilians traded so far! 



It is important to remember that utilising Civilians requires a slow, steady and strategic approach so do not rush in and buy more Civilians than you can manage to sustain, as each Civilian still requires 4 Red Energy Units in sustenance each week. To refresh your memory of how Civilians function in general, please check out this article or continue reading to cover a few additional points related to the new Earth 2 Civilian Bazaar:




Each First Edition Civilian currently requires at least a Mentar on a 4 tile property



These Civilians are First Edition and will cease to be available for synthesis at some point in the future



These First Edition Civilians may have the ability to play or partake in new and specific roles in the future and may hold part of  a key to future Second Gen Civilians on Earth 2



The Civilian Bazaar sees another significant update which allows First Edition Civilians that are purchased from the Bazaar to work individually on a property without requiring other Civilians to be present! For example, you may purchase a Level 6 Raid Commander for a property that has no other Civilians, whereas if you were to synthesise these Civilians yourself, you would be required to also synthesise the E-ther Reckoner and Cydroid Technician first.&nbsp;




HOW TO LIST A CIVILIAN FOR SALE ON THE BAZAAR



Listing a Civilian for sale on the Bazaar is easy to do via the Civilian Management interface.&nbsp;



Players may choose to sell Civilians from a specific property or sell a specific Civilian from any property, and this can be done by viewing their Civilians by Properties or Civilians, respectively.&nbsp;



STEP 1: Go to Raid Management &gt; Civilian Management and select either the Civilians or Properties tab






STEP 2: Find the Civilian you wish to sell. You can browse or use the search, filter and sort tools to find your Civilian quickly.&nbsp;






TIP: You can also search by Properties if you are looking to sell all the Civilians from a specific property.&nbsp;






STEP 3: Select the desired Civilian and the SELL CIVILIAN option will appear on the right-hand side. 






STEP 4: Confirm the logistics details (only Teleportation method temporarily available)&nbsp;






STEP 5: Set the sale price of your Civilian. Also take this opportunity to make sure you have selected the correct Civilian.&nbsp;






STEP 6: Confirm the listing!&nbsp;






STEP 7: You can check your new listing by going to the Bazaar and toggling the SHOW button to MY LISTINGS






You can also see which Civilians you have currently listed for sale within your Civilian Management interface, as they are conveniently marked with a ‘FOR SALE’ label. 






THE CIVILIAN BAZAAR



Once listed on the Bazaar, each Civilian listing will display various unique details about that specific Civilian, such as:




Edition



Faction



Occupation



Level



Red Energy remaining



Location








The back of the Civilian listing card also reveals details of the Civilian’s unique specifications such as its:




Gender



The exact amount of XP it currently has








It is important to note that for now Civilians can be instantly teleported to a property on purchase. This is a limited time feature that will only remain available until Earth 2’s Civilian transportation logistic system comes online at some point in the future.



Importantly, Civilians can also be listed on the Bazaar whilst in the middle of undertaking a task, as well as continue to work whilst being listed. However, if the Civilian begins wandering, the Civilian will automatically be removed from the Bazaar and the seller must recapture their Civilian using Red Energy to lure them back before being able to relist their Civilian on the Bazaar.&nbsp; Evidently, Civilians listed on the Bazaar must remain sustained by Red Energy Units or will be automatically be delisted once they begin to wander.

====================================================================================================
October 16, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Zirconium is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system! There have been well over 1240 claims submitted for Zirconium since its release and with only 10 more foundational Resources remaining, don&#8217;t miss your chance to claim any of the currently available Resources. 



Zirconium was introduced as a late addition to the 21 new Resources announced for release since the initial round of Resources were distributed in Earth 2 (Wood, Water, Sand, Gold, Limestone, Coal, Oil and Iron Ore). Despite this &#8220;late&#8221; introduction, Zirconium has an important role in the Earth 2 EcoSim, influencing the Building Blocks Players will be able to obtain using this Resource. The real world offers so many wonderful Resources and it is part of the natural progression, as the EcoSim evolves and grows in complexity, that new Resources will be introduced within Earth 2 from time to time. While they may appear seemingly suddenly, their inclusion and role in the EcoSim is one that has been carefully considered.



This is a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have this (or any active released) Resources present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.



If you missed it, you can check out the announcement about the Resources Overview release here.&nbsp;



Players please be advised that there is currently a greater than usual delay with the approval of claims and the distribution of Zirconium to approved areas. We would like to reassure Players that this delay will be resolved and we thank you for your ongoing patience during this delay. 



New Resources Released: (as at 16 October, 2023)





ZIRCONIUM (09 October, 2023)





Zirconium is a metal with unique characteristics and is primarily found in the mineral zircon. Boasting a strong resistance to corrosion by acids, alkalis, and seawater, it is often used in the nuclear industry in radioactive shielding due to its low neutron absorption properties. Its applications extend beyond nuclear reactors, as Zirconium&#8217;s compounds also play pivotal roles in ceramics for capacitors, foundry equipment, and many other areas of material science.

Title: Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels &#8211; Iron
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/10/19/resources-iron/

====================================================================================================
October 19, 2023- Sydney, Australia &#8211; Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels. You may have heard these mentioned before, or seen our weekly Resource release announcements. But what are they and what role do they play in the Earth 2 EcoSim? 



To understand how Prospecting Cydroids, Resources and Prime Jewels relate to each other, and most importantly, how you will be able to use them in your own EcoSim adventures, continue reading this article!



A QUICK RECAP



Resources



Just like our planet Earth, Earth 2 also has Resources that are distributed across virtual land, uniquely based on their geolocation. There will initially be 32 official Resources that will form the foundation for the core building aspect of the EcoSim, 13 of which&nbsp; are still currently available via the E2PRV system.&nbsp;



If you have a specific Resource on your property you will have the ability to mine that Resource by gaining its Occurrence Units(OUs) which will in turn be processed by the Weaver into Raw Materials. Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks required for constructing a variety of Buildings, Factories, Power Cells, Engines (for various types of transportation), Energy Producing Technologies, Advert Billboards, Machinery, Military-Grade Technologies, and more inside Earth 2’s open 3D world, E2V1.



Prime Jewels



As their name alludes to, Prime Jewels have the ability to prime the Resource they are linked to. This can be done by slotting the Prime Jewel associated with the Resource you want to prime into your Mentar. To put it simply, slotting will enable the Mentar to read and collect the specific Resource’s Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



See the full list of released Resources and their associated Prime Jewels below. A new Resource from the chart is released weekly so make sure to keep an eye out for our announcements!  







Prospecting Cydroids



Prospecting Cydroids are the product of modifications made to the base model Raiding Cydroids, which have typically been built and used to raid neighbouring properties of their unstable E-ther &#8211; to date. While the ability to modify Raiding Cydroids has not yet been enabled,&nbsp; the revelation of exactly which Cydroids are linked to which Resource/s allows Players to prepare the Cydroids corresponding to the Resources that are abundant on their property/ies.&nbsp;



It is important to note that in order to modify a First Edition (a.k.a. Raiding) Cydroid, you will need to follow a process which involves fusing the relevant Primary Jewel with the relevant Cydroid &#8211; to refresh your memory more information can be found in our previous announcement https://earth2.io/news/major-ecosim-update under ‘Prospecting Cydroids’.



Now with P2P trading of Cydroids in the Earth 2 Bazaar, it is easier than ever to get the Cydroid you need for the Resources you have on your property. Here is a list of all the Resources released to date, including the Cydroids and Jewels associated with Round 1 Resources which are no longer available to claim. This list will progressively grow as we announce 1 Resource and the corresponding Cydroid and Jewel each week.

Title: Resource Release: Molybdenum
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/10/30/resources-molybdenum/

====================================================================================================
October 30, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Molybdenum is currently available to claim, with over 500 claims approved already! Molybdenum is also the first of the Discovery Tier 7 Resources to be released. Players should be aware that Resources from D7 onwards will only be mineable on Tier 1 properties.



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Molybdenum (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.



If you missed it, you can check out the announcement about the Resources Overview release here.&nbsp;

Title: Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels &#8211; Silver
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/10/31/resources-silver/

====================================================================================================
October 31, 2023- Sydney, Australia &#8211; Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels. You may have heard these mentioned before, or seen our weekly Resource release announcements. But what are they and what role do they play in the Earth 2 EcoSim? 



To understand how Prospecting Cydroids, Resources and Prime Jewels relate to each other, and most importantly, how you will be able to use them in your own EcoSim adventures, continue reading this article!



A QUICK RECAP



Resources



Just like our planet Earth, Earth 2 also has Resources that are distributed across virtual land, uniquely based on their geolocation. There will initially be 32 official Resources that will form the foundation for the core building aspect of the EcoSim, 13 of which&nbsp; are still currently available via the E2PRV system.&nbsp;



If you have a specific Resource on your property you will have the ability to mine that Resource by gaining its Occurrence Units(OUs) which will in turn be processed by the Weaver into Raw Materials. Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks required for constructing a variety of Buildings, Factories, Power Cells, Engines (for various types of transportation), Energy Producing Technologies, Advert Billboards, Machinery, Military-Grade Technologies, and more inside Earth 2’s open 3D world, E2V1.



Prime Jewels



As their name alludes to, Prime Jewels have the ability to prime the Resource they are linked to. This can be done by slotting the Prime Jewel associated with the Resource you want to prime into your Mentar. To put it simply, slotting will enable the Mentar to read and collect the specific Resource’s Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



See the full list of released Resources and their associated Prime Jewels below. A new Resource from the chart is released weekly so make sure to keep an eye out for our announcements!&nbsp;&nbsp;







Prospecting Cydroids



Prospecting Cydroids are the product of modifications made to the base model Raiding Cydroids, which have typically been built and used to raid neighbouring properties of their unstable E-ther &#8211; to date. While the ability to modify Raiding Cydroids has not yet been enabled,&nbsp; the revelation of exactly which Cydroids are linked to which Resource/s allows Players to prepare the Cydroids corresponding to the Resources that are abundant on their property/ies.&nbsp;



It is important to note that in order to modify a First Edition (a.k.a. Raiding) Cydroid, you will need to follow a process which involves fusing the relevant Primary Jewel with the relevant Cydroid &#8211; to refresh your memory more information can be found in our previous announcement https://earth2.io/news/major-ecosim-update under ‘Prospecting Cydroids’.



Now with P2P trading of Cydroids in the Earth 2 Bazaar, it is easier than ever to get the Cydroid you need for the Resources you have on your property. Here is a list of all the Resources released to date, including the Cydroids and Jewels associated with Round 1 Resources which are no longer available to claim. This list will progressively grow as we announce 1 Resource and the corresponding Cydroid and Jewel each week.

Title: Happy 3rd Anniversary Earth 2
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/05/e2-turns-3/

====================================================================================================
November 5,  2023 &#8211; Sydney Australia &#8211; We’d like to wish Earth 2 and the Community a Happy 3rd Anniversary! The past 12 months have been hands-on and arduous with Earth 2 taking a step up in the complexity of publicly released features since our last birthday celebrations. 



While these releases have been web based and may not be visually appealing, they are still powered by robust game mechanic engines that process a significant amount of real-time data every second of the day, and set foundations for the long term backend software required to run future game mechanics inside E2V1. Perhaps more importantly, the majority of these features were designed around the concept of rewarding Players who have remained active on the Earth 2 platform while we continue building.



To mark the beginning of our birthday celebrations, and before any further releases or announcements are made, let’s take a moment to reflect on the feature releases, updates and progress that Earth 2 has made over the past 12 months under the new Game Design team, as well as a number of new team members.&nbsp;



Seeing these updates collectively not only shows a development pipeline trend but also demonstrates how proactive Earth 2 has been at building through what many would say was a bear market:  







November 11, 2022 &#8211; Feature Release







U2U HB TRADING v1.1 + MORE







This release saw significant updates to the U2U HB Trading Bazaar which included a number of complex architectures such as the Royalties tracking system which has the ability to track original creators ownership, resale history (including accurate distribution of royalties to the original creator), and can even go as far as tracking multiple creative ownership with accurate compensation when blueprints/holobuildings from multiple creator-Players were involved in the sold product.



The Royalties tracking system will prove useful in future planned products for Earth 2.



In addition to the Royalties system, the November 11 update also included :&nbsp;




Limited Edition HBs allowing Players to set rarity on their creations;



The ability to resell HB creations;



Property Deed page displaying Slotted Jewels;



An easier method to deploy or edit a Holobuilding directly from the Property Deed page;



Added new quality filter to the Jewel Slotting and Crafting page;



Display Resources &amp; their frequencies on Properties on the Jewel Slotting page;



Option to load the Jewel Slotting page directly from the Property Deed;

November 23, 2022 &#8211; Feature Release







E-THER and ESSENCE DECIMALISATION



A preemptive feature release that was not only required for Raiding but also to accommodate any potential future pricing fluctuations on the Essence token price.&nbsp; At first glance this update appears simple, but required a significant rework of our back end E-ther distribution mechanics which resulted in Players receiving more frequent spawning of E-ther on their properties.



Key point summary + other updates released on November 23 :&nbsp;




E-ther transitioning to a 2 decimal place system;



Essence transitioning to a 4 decimal place system;



Re-work of back end distribution mechanics resulting in more frequent E-ther distribution on properties;



Country price ticker on landing page when selected will take Player to last purchased property in that country.

November 30, 2022 &#8211; Team Milestone &#8211; Player Withdrawals







OVER $19M USD processed by Earth 2 



A milestone announcement illustrating the results of the hard work and dedication of the Earth 2 accounting team having processed and paying out over $19M USD in payments to Earth 2 Players all over the world, and the software systems our development team built to make sure such results were achievable. The article also points out the significant outlay of capital Earth 2 pays for the legal processing of such payments highlighting its dedication to the Earth 2 Player group.



Key points :&nbsp;




Earth 2 processed over $19M USD in withdrawal payouts to Players;



Earth 2 paid over $323K USD for KYC processing alone, at not cost to the Player;



Earth 2 paid an average of $8.21 USD for Card Withdrawals, $7.72 USD for Earth 2 Virtual Credit Card withdrawals and $21.72 USD for problematic withdrawals per withdrawal;&nbsp;



It costs Earth 2 $20 USD per Virtual Credit Card and this cost was not passed on to any Players;



Completely cleared backlog of any withdrawals and we still maintain a speedy withdrawal time for most Players.

March 16, 2023 &#8211; Major Feature Release







RAIDING V1 GOES LIVE ON EARTH 2!



The first major feature release of 2023, and a massive release in itself, that has been iterated on throughout the year, Raiding was first introduced to Earth 2 Players in March, 2023. Version 1 of Raiding would allow Players to raid unstable E-ther from neighbouring Players’ accounts, rewarding active Players at the same time as taking advantage of E-ther that would otherwise evaporate. Many Players have greatly benefited from this feature which enabled Players to obtain more E-ther than they would typically get through claiming E-ther generated from their property/ies alone.&nbsp;



The Raiding Game Engine works in real-time on a global scale, processing massive amounts of data on a daily basis. At a glance, it allows Players to :&nbsp;




Build and tether Cydroids to their Mentar;



Determine tethered Cydroid count based on property size;



Power and De-Power the Cydroid using Essence;



Burn energy which alternates based on numerous various states of the Cydroid;



Recharge the Cydroid;



Target Properties to Raid within a specific range;



Determine arrival times based on Cydroid speed;



Determine the E-ther stability on target property based on numerous factors;



Storage bay for Cydroids including calculator of storage amount based on raid property target;



Raid property target E-ther distribution system if more than one Cydroid or more than one Player attacks the same property at the same time;



Update to Essence balance ledger system (transactions);



…and more.




Even in the absence of an official announcement over 280,000 Cydroids were built by Players in the first 24 hours after the stealth deployment.



The original article can be found here : https://earth2.io/news/raiding-v1







March 16, 2023 &#8211; Footage Release







FOOTAGE OF RAIDING INSIDE E2V1



In conjunction with the official Raiding v1 article on March 16, a sneak peek video showcasing Cydroids raiding E-ther inside E2V1 was published which included a high level overview of the Raiding system.

April 14, 2023 &#8211; Feature Reopening







E2PRV REOPENS



The E2 Player Resource Validation system was reopened to officially release Silver and Copper Resources. The reopening came with a number of adjustments to the previous model including :&nbsp;




A 6.5% reward for successful claims and stakes (in addition to the Resource being granted for the claimant);



A 50% reduction in the Assurance Fee;



A new timing countdown system that provided more time for Players to review the claim before it became stakable by other Players.

April 20, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







E-THER TRANSACTIONS



The E-ther Transactions update was required for synthesising Civilians and while it visually appeared to be a simple update on the front end of the website, considerable updates to the server back end and processing systems were required. Behind closed doors our BE developers considered this a major update.




Complete rework of BE system allowing a new aggregated global balance of E-ther per Player (where previously E-ther balances were only saved per Mentar);



New system now records and displays E-ther claim transactions per property on the Players ledger as opposed to only showing in Essence when the Player transformed;



Major rework to calculate EDC reduction on point of claiming E-ther and not at point of transformation to Essence;



Protection against external Raids on a Players’ property reducing their EDC balance;



Dispensed E-ther from Raiding now showing on the transactions page.

May 3, 2023 &#8211; Game Design Details







EARTH 2’s FIRST SUSTENANCE SYSTEM



This Game Design reveal was the first time Players learned about the existence of a sustenance system for Civilians which would change many of the expected dynamics of the auto-raid system giving Players more to think about and strategise toward.&nbsp;



The article covered an in-depth explanation of how the sustenance system would function including key details such as how much Red Energy each Civilian would require, the frequency of sustenance required, and what would occur if a Civilian ran out of Red Energy.

May 17, 2023 &#8211; Game Design Details







CIVILIAN XP + RAID COMMANDER TARGETING SYSTEM



The next surprise additions to the Civilian Game Design came in the form of Civilian XP and the Raid Commander Targeting system. The original Game Design scope did not include an XP system or an automated targeting system.&nbsp;



These two systems combined with the sustenance system were expansions to the original concept and while their design and development pushed back the official release of Civilians, collectively they also introduced a number of new playing dynamics with more robust game loops.



Without listing every detail, at a high level this now meant that Civilians could be trained or learn to be more efficient as their XP increased as a result of successful raiding missions. The more XP they earned, the higher their Mastery Level, the faster they could work without supervision.



The design of the Riad Commander Civilian&#8217;s auto-targeting system utilising Favourite icons of multiple shapes and colours combined with the chronological order of the recently raided list now meant that Players could adopt multiple strategies in targeting and retargeting properties in their cross hairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

June 18, 2023 &#8211; Major Game Design Details Release







THE WEAVER, PROSPECTING CYDROIDS and RESOURCES



June saw a major release of in-depth core game design details and mechanics for core facets from the next phase of the EcoSim. A number of the designs from the previous design team had to be reworked and in some cases complete gaps filled before the overall design could be brought back to a stage where we could confidently share details with our Players.



Overall this took months of reworking, replanning, running simulations, crunching figures and ensuring various systems were designed in a way that would work together. The reworking had to be completed to a position 5 steps ahead so we could then trace back to release the step 1 details which were covered in this article.



Often our Players understandably feel that the feature we are releasing at the time of release is the full focus for the game design team, but this announcement served as a reminder that game design is well ahead of development now and works in parallel designing future features while also actively helping with the release of current features seen by the public.



This particular game design release included details such as :&nbsp;




Confirmation of 21 new Resources required for the EcoSim base version;



The Prime Jewels for such Resources, revealing more utility for higher tier Jewels;



How Resources will be discovered and obtained;



Details about how binary data found in E-ther evaporating from Resource rich land is to be measured in Occurrence Units (OUs);



The introduction of Prospecting Cydroids, indirectly confirming that Cydroids will receive more Utility and Jewels related to these Prospecting Cydroids will be in higher demand;



Prospecting Cydroids will not only have the ability to increase OU yield but will be required for higher Discovery Tier Resources;&nbsp;



New details about Resource Frequency and how it will work;



Details about the OU read process, how OUs are measured and the confirmation of a new Civilian being required;



Confirmation about Holobuilding Storage and the transfer of OUs;



Details about the Replication process and how OU data can be ported into the Weaver to create Raw Materials;



Information about storing and selling Raw Materials.

July 5, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







OPTIONAL CAMPAIGN &#8211; WOOD, WATER, SAND



In order to avoid potential inconsistencies between our satellite based website map and our 3D world, E2V1, it was determined that these 3 crucial Resources should have location and distribution confirmed inside E2V1 at a later date.



Because of this, the wood, water and sand optional campaign was created to provide Players with an avenue to backdate Occurrence Units for these specific Resources which included a little bit of rule bending.



A number of software adjustments on our back end system were required to accommodate for this optional campaign, but the summary is that Players were provided with a 7 week window to slot relevant Prime Jewels for wood, water or sand, onto their properties along with HoloBuildings to gain the opportunity to receive fully backdated OUs with a bonus boost being offered on properties that had not yet detected any Resources.



While most of the work on this feature happened in the back end, some front end work such as updates to the resource filter on the Jewel Slotting page were made in connection with this release.

July 22, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







NEW LOOK JEWELS + INVENTORY UI UPDATE



This release comprised of two parts, the revealing of the new look Jewels and a rework and design of the Jewel Inventory pages.



The Jewels were completely redesigned to move away from the cartoonish feel and move toward a more realistic feel which would be better suited inside of E2V1. Our game design team worked very closely with concept art to meticulously redesign each and every Jewel around 3 base types of crystalline, polished and coarse.



The Jewel Inventory’s new UI was designed to improve the ability to find and slot Jewels as well as to match the yet to be released (at the time) Cydroid slotting UI.&nbsp; Though it appears simple, the Jewel Inventory pages contain a number of complicated mechanisms which required some heavy focus from our FE team to ensure all mechanisms worked correctly after being connected to the new interface.



The original article can be found here : https://earth2.io/news/jewels-and-inventory-update







July 23, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







RESOURCES OVERVIEW PROFILE PAGE



The Resources Overview release included a new feature that would assist Players in getting a clearer picture of their Resource ownership across properties in their land portfolio.&nbsp; Though the page started with a mere handful of D1 Resources, it has now grown to cover a much more extensive list of Resources and provides valuable information to Players on a daily basis.



The original article can be found here : https://earth2.io/news/resources-overview







July 28, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







PROFILE OVERVIEW



The Profile Overview was a sizable Feature Release that provided Players with a centralised overview of various items they own on the Earth 2 platform. This update not only allowed Players to gain a valuable insight into the breakdown of their accumulated digital items but also provides a historical chart which displays comparative line graphs to track Player trends in key generation, collection and other activities.

August 11, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







COLLECTIVE JEWEL BOOST OVERVIEW



A very useful update to the Jewel Slotting page, this release provided Players with a nice overview summarising the collective boost total results from multiple Jewels being slotted on the same Mentar.&nbsp; This summary shows how many Jewels are slotted and the total end percentage once any reductions are accounted for giving the Player a clear indication of what type of boosts they will expect around Resources in the future.



The original article can be found here : NEW JEWEL BOOST OVERVIEW FOR RESOURCES &#8211; News &#8211; Earth 2®







August 17, 2023 &#8211; Major Feature Release







CYDROID JEWEL SLOTTING &amp; MANAGEMENT



Highly anticipated since the release of Cydroids to the platform, the release of the Cydroid Management interface would allow Players to manage their Cydroids across their portfolio of properties. But more importantly within this interface, Players would be able to slot Jewels into a Cydroid to receive a multitude of different desired Boost effects.



This feature release further extended Utility for Jewels and opened up a number of new strategies for Players Raiding E-ther with the new-found opportunity to make their Cydroids :&nbsp;




Raid further;



Dispense E-ther faster;



Carry more E-ther in their Storage Bays;



Travel faster;



Last longer;



Relocate farther;



…And more.




These boosts vary based on the quality of each Jewel meaning there are multiple sub-categories per boost type and the system needed to be designed in such a way that Jewels are locked when actively being used by the Cydroids.Furthermore, the interface for slotting Cydroids was developed to be dynamic allowing Players to conveniently visualise the results of their Jewel slotting instantly.

August 28, 2023 &#8211; Major Feature Release







P2P BAZAAR CYDROID TRADING



This major release being developed in parallel with Cydroid slotting saw the first new digital item become tradable between Players on the Bazaar for some time. It was a clear extension of Earth 2’s player-to-player trading system and perfectly aligned with our ideology to give Players control over the digital items they own,&nbsp; including the ability to sell those items in an open, Player-driven market.



This feature also provides the opportunity for new Players who do not yet have the opportunity to gather Essence quickly enough, to purchase a Cydroid locked, loaded and ready to take advantage of raiding opportunities.



The Cydroid Bazaar was a significant release, so to refresh your memory, the original article can be found here : P2P Cydroid Trading NOW LIVE &#8211; News &#8211; Earth 2®







September 5, 2023 &#8211; Feature Release







JEWEL BAZAAR UPDATE



This update brought the Jewel Bazaar UI up to date and in line with the recently released Cydroid Bazaar. The update included implementation of the Earth 2 dark theme but perhaps more notably saw the introduction of bulk buying Jewels become available to Players.



This release also included a new filter in the Marketplace which allowed Players to search for specific size properties for sale by other Players.

October, 2023 &#8211; Resource Releases







RESOURCE RELEASES



During October we saw 5 new Resource releases and the details of 4 Resources spread between D1-D3 confirmed. Each release of a new Resource requires updates from the FE and BE team who need to work together with QA to ensure :&nbsp;




The correct Resource is represented in the correct places (Claims, Resources, Profile etc);



The Prospecting Cydroid name is updated;



The heatmaps are connected and working;



The E2PRV system is connected and working (multiple steps);



…And more.




This is handled by team members while they are focusing on other development tasks, but it’s worth noting the Resource releases do involve a number of steps.&nbsp; Furthermore, Game Design and Concept Art work together to :&nbsp;




Confirm building blocks;



Icons for building blocks;



Artwork for Cydroid + Jewel + other details.




In total, 16 new Resources have been processed and published to date during our very busy schedule developing other upcoming features.

THANK YOU



Thank you for taking the time to look over our achievements these past 12 months. Collectively they really do demonstrate how proactive we’ve been designing, developing and releasing products all while progressing on E2V1 and other facets of the Earth 2 platform.



We can confirm that we do have a number of features, details and videos to release over the remaining part of this year through November and December, but some of these releases are interdependent and may take longer than anticipated to stabilise, therefore we have decided not to provide a list in this article to avoid the possibility of disappointment within the Community.  



While we will try to provide a few hints in the next article, looking back on what we have achieve the past 12 months and considered where we are now at with E2V1, we are most excited and looking forward to where we will be in 12 months from now!



Fun Fact: The Avatar featured in the image for this article is one of the first of its kind created by the Earth 2 team using our own internal Avatar pipeline we have been developing behind closed doors. All of her clothing items are also 100% custom made by our own internal 3D modelling team.

Article 91
Title: Resource Release: Boron
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/06/resources-boron/

====================================================================================================
November 6, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Boron is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system! Remember that Discovery Tier 7 Resources onwards will only be mineable on Tier 1 properties.



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Boron (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.

The most up to date guidelines on how to submit a valid E2PRV claim can be found in this article, under the Guidelines for Claim Submission heading: https://earth2.io/news/copper-silver-guidelines&nbsp;&nbsp;



Below is a useful table showcasing which Jewels are associated with each released Resource:









*N.B. The CAT have provided a list of approved ores/minerals in order to assist Players in making a valid claim. However, Resource claim validation and Frequency Category attribution is always at the sole discretion of the Earth 2 CAT and there is no guarantee that ores/minerals not confirmed by Earth 2 will be approved. The above list of approved ores and minerals is also not a guarantee of approval, as valid evidence must still be provided and any other criteria for validation must also be met. Please remember that the guidelines set out by Earth 2 are designed to assist and safeguard Players who participate in the E2PRV system. Players should exclusively, carefully and precisely follow official Earth 2 guidelines to mitigate any loss of Essence or Assurance Fees due to submitting an invalid claim. Players who choose to ignore official guidelines do so at their own (and fellow staking Players’) risk.

Article 92
Title: Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels &#8211; Oil
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/07/resources-oil/

====================================================================================================
November 7, 2023- Sydney, Australia &#8211; Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels. You may have heard these mentioned before, or seen our weekly Resource release announcements. But what are they and what role do they play in the Earth 2 EcoSim? 



To understand how Prospecting Cydroids, Resources and Prime Jewels relate to each other, and most importantly, how you will be able to use them in your own EcoSim adventures, continue reading this article!



A QUICK RECAP



Resources



Just like our planet Earth, Earth 2 also has Resources that are distributed across virtual land, uniquely based on their geolocation. There will initially be 32 official Resources that will form the foundation for the core building aspect of the EcoSim, 13 of which&nbsp; are still currently available via the E2PRV system.&nbsp;



If you have a specific Resource on your property you will have the ability to mine that Resource by gaining its Occurrence Units(OUs) which will in turn be processed by the Weaver into Raw Materials. Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks required for constructing a variety of Buildings, Factories, Power Cells, Engines (for various types of transportation), Energy Producing Technologies, Advert Billboards, Machinery, Military-Grade Technologies, and more inside Earth 2’s open 3D world, E2V1.



Prime Jewels



As their name alludes to, Prime Jewels have the ability to prime the Resource they are linked to. This can be done by slotting the Prime Jewel associated with the Resource you want to prime into your Mentar. To put it simply, slotting will enable the Mentar to read and collect the specific Resource’s Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



See the full list of released Resources and their associated Prime Jewels below. A new Resource from the chart is released weekly so make sure to keep an eye out for our announcements!&nbsp;&nbsp;







Prospecting Cydroids



Prospecting Cydroids are the product of modifications made to the base model Raiding Cydroids, which have typically been built and used to raid neighbouring properties of their unstable E-ther &#8211; to date. While the ability to modify Raiding Cydroids has not yet been enabled,&nbsp; the revelation of exactly which Cydroids are linked to which Resource/s allows Players to prepare the Cydroids corresponding to the Resources that are abundant on their property/ies.&nbsp;



It is important to note that in order to modify a First Edition (a.k.a. Raiding) Cydroid, you will need to follow a process which involves fusing the relevant Primary Jewel with the relevant Cydroid &#8211; to refresh your memory more information can be found in our previous announcement https://earth2.io/news/major-ecosim-update under ‘Prospecting Cydroids’.



Now with P2P trading of Cydroids in the Earth 2 Bazaar, it is easier than ever to get the Cydroid you need for the Resources you have on your property. Here is a list of all the Resources released to date, including the Cydroids and Jewels associated with Round 1 Resources which are no longer available to claim. This list will progressively grow as we announce 1 Resource and the corresponding Cydroid and Jewel each week.



Latest Confirmed Resource



Oil (No longer available to claim via E2PRV)



Oil stands as the cornerstone of industrial prowess. Not only is it the catalyst for crafting versatile materials like plastics and rubbers, it also fuels the flames of progress, serving as a vital petrochemical source and essential heating agent.







Previously Confirmed Resources



DISCOVERY TIER 1 



Iron (No longer available to claim via E2PRV)

====================================================================================================
November 9, 2023- Sydney, Australia &#8211; Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels. You may have heard these mentioned before, or seen our weekly Resource release announcements. But what are they and what role do they play in the Earth 2 EcoSim?&nbsp;



To understand how Prospecting Cydroids, Resources and Prime Jewels relate to each other, and most importantly, how you will be able to use them in your own EcoSim adventures, continue reading this article!



A QUICK RECAP



Resources



Just like our planet Earth, Earth 2 also has Resources that are distributed across virtual land, uniquely based on their geolocation. There will initially be 32 official Resources that will form the foundation for the core building aspect of the EcoSim, 13 of which&nbsp; are still currently available via the E2PRV system.&nbsp;



If you have a specific Resource on your property you will have the ability to mine that Resource by gaining its Occurrence Units(OUs) which will in turn be processed by the Weaver into Raw Materials. Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks required for constructing a variety of Buildings, Factories, Power Cells, Engines (for various types of transportation), Energy Producing Technologies, Advert Billboards, Machinery, Military-Grade Technologies, and more inside Earth 2’s open 3D world, E2V1.



Prime Jewels



As their name alludes to, Prime Jewels have the ability to prime the Resource they are linked to. This can be done by slotting the Prime Jewel associated with the Resource you want to prime into your Mentar. To put it simply, slotting will enable the Mentar to read and collect the specific Resource’s Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



See the full list of released Resources and their associated Prime Jewels below. A new Resource from the chart is released weekly so make sure to keep an eye out for our announcements!&nbsp;&nbsp;







Prospecting Cydroids

Title: Resource Release: Tantalum
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/13/resources-tantalum/

====================================================================================================
November 13, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Tantalum is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system! Remember that Discovery Tier 7 Resources onwards will only be mineable on Tier 1 properties. 



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Tantalum (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.

Title: &#8216;Abort Raid&#8217; A New Civilian Ability
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/14/abort-raid/

====================================================================================================
November 14, 2023 – Sydney, Australia – Assemble your Faction, put your Red Energy on standby and slot up on those Catseye Jewels to get ready for some fast and furious raiding! A new civilian ability has been released on Earth 2, the Raid Abort. Unlocking this new ability provides the Raid Commander with the option to abort an ongoing raid when the Cydroid is in the Scanning phase, or as Earth 2 Players like to refer to as the dreaded “??:??:??” ! 



This new ability will provide situations where a Player can cut down scouting time for good raid targets from 10 in 10 days to 10 in 10 minutes! It is a game changer for the speculative Raider searching for their next set of targets.



How do I unlock this new Abort ability?



In order to unlock this ability Players first need to ensure that all Civilians in their Raid Team at that specific Mentar are from the same Faction.&nbsp; For example, the Raid Commander, E-ther Reckoner and Cydroid Technician must be from the same Faction. Depending on the Faction, the ability to Abort Raids will unlock when the Raid Commander reaches level 3 (Space Force), level 2 (Rebels), or even as early as level 1 (Egyptian)!



Next, the Player will need to infuse Red Energy into the Raid Commander and it is this step that will then unlock the ability for the Raid Commander to recall their raiding Cydroids at any point in the Raiding process.The Cydroid will immediately stop scanning and return home, after which it will be ready for the next command.



The table below provides an overview of the Red Energy and corresponding Aborts associated based on the matching Faction type:







Where can I use the ‘Abort Raid’ ability?



Aborting a raid can be done through the Raid Panel or through the Raid Commanders’ Ability Menu in Civilian Management. The Icons shown in the Raid Panel will now help easily identify whether or not aborting a raid is possible.&nbsp;



When the Cydroid Icon, Civilian Icon, and Raid tab appear in Yellow this means the Raid Team’s Faction matches and is complete. However, there is no Red Energy infused in the Raid Commander and therefore no Raid Aborts available. This may be due to the Raid Commander or team lacking experience, or because they are not infused yet.&nbsp;






If Raid Aborts are available, these icons will appear in Green which lets you know the Raid Team on this Mentar is ready to abort raids on command!&nbsp;






If you’re unsure about how much Red Energy your matching Civilians will require, rest assured you’ll always receive a pop-up like the one below that informs you just how much Red Energy is required before you commence with the infusion.






What are some possible strategies?



Without the Abort Raid option, Raids can often get stuck in the Scanning phase(??:??:??) for up to a full day depending on when the raid was launched. The Cydroid remains in the indeterminate scanning (??:??:??) phase until it determines whether the E-ther will become unstable or not.



There are many different possible strategies but here are the steps to&nbsp; one that may work for some Players :&nbsp;




Find a location with a lot of properties, or a few isolated medium size properties, and a reasonable new tile price;.



Purchase a 4 tile property and Build a Cydroid or buy one from the Bazaar;



To save time waiting for the Cydroid to hit its target and return, we recommend to load up your Cydroid’s&nbsp; slots with Catseye Jewels, even cracked Catseye Jewels can speed up the Cydroid’s travelling speed significantly;








Ensure you have 3 matching Civilians (same Faction) and infuse some Red Energy (which is earned on each successful Raid if you don’t have enough already);



Infuse some Red Energy into your Raid Commander from the Raid Menu or the Ability Menu in Civilian Management;



Start targeting the larger properties closest to you and watch the Raiding timer so you can see when your Cydroid arrives at the Raid Target and whether it gets stuck or not;



If the Cydroid gets stuck scanning (??:??:??), the Abort Raid ability can be used. Remember to mark the property you just targeted with a Favourite icon, like a white heart, so you know there was no unstable E-ther immediately available but it might have some later;



Keep repeating steps 6 and 7 to get through your list and identify the best targets near you!



If you have a good feeling about your Raiding location then maybe buy a 10 tile or 30 tile property there to tether 2-3 Cydroids, converting to Auto Raid with your Civilians once your scouting is done!




Here is a helpful table to see the maximum number of Cydroids that can be tethered to properties of different sizes:







Remember, if the Cydroid returns immediately then that means there was not even any stable E-ther detected.&nbsp; If it gets stuck scanning (??:??:??) that means your Cydroid HAS detected stable E-ther so your Cydroid will wait on the property until it becomes unstable. However, during this time, the owner could claim the stable E-ther at any time and your Cydroid might still miss out and return without E-ther. This is when the Abort Raid ability is key.



What happens to the Aborts if I sell my Raid Commander?



Although unlocked by having a full team of Civilians from the same Faction, the ‘Abort Raid’ ability is inherently tied to the Raid Commander. If a Player sells or purchases a property with a Raid Commander, or sells the Raid Commander via the Bazaar, all infused Raid Aborts will be included in the sale and transfers with the Raid Commander to the new owner.



What happens to the Aborts if I sell my other Civilians?



The Raid Commander always needs to be part of a full Raid Team of the same Faction. If one or more of its fellow Raid Team Civilians are sold, these Civilians will need to be replaced in order for the ‘Raid Abort’ ability to become usable again.&nbsp;



What happens when I purchase a Raid Commander with infused Raid Aborts?



If you purchase a Raid Commander and send it to a property that does not have Civilians of a matching Faction, the Raid Commander will retain its Raid Aborts but they will not be usable until the Raid Commander is joined by other Civilians from the same Faction.&nbsp;



This can be done by synthesising or purchasing the E-ther Reckoner and Cydroid Technician from the same Faction, or selling the Raid Commander and purchasing one from the Faction that matches the existing Civilian/s on your property.&nbsp;






For added convenience, when purchasing Civilians from the Bazaar, Players are able to see which Faction the existing Civilians on a property belong to by hovering over the current Raid Team count for each property:






We hope this article has been helpful in explaining the new Abort Raid feature! Keep following us for more updates, reveals and releases, especially over the remaining part of our Birthday month and into December.

Title: Resource Release: Tellurium
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/21/resources-tellurium/

====================================================================================================
November 21, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Tellurium is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system, with only 5 more resources left to reveal! 



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Tellurium (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.

Title: Territories &#8211; Boosted E-ther, Governance System &amp; T3 Land  
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/27/territories/

====================================================================================================
November 27, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; A little over a week ago Earth 2 deployed its 6th major feature release of 2023!&nbsp; This release was not an isolated feature alone but is comprised of 3 separate systems: the Boosted E-ther land mechanic system, the first version of the Governance system and the release of the final tier of land inside Earth 2 &#8211; Tier 3 &#8211; which comes with its own entirely new land mechanics system. Each of these 3 are standalone and unique features in their own right, but due to the fact all 3 systems have various levels of interconnectedness with one another, we decided to launch them as a package.



Continue reading to learn more about all 3 of these new systems, including what each system is, how they work and what part they play in the big picture for Earth 2!







Stealth Release Details







Released as a stealth launch without any official announcement, the Earth 2 Community was quick to discover the new Boosted E-ther, Governance and Tier 3 land systems and run them through their paces! Earth 2 Players have already submitted over 600 Territories worldwide, and over 70 million votes were placed by the time the first and second Territories were voted in by the Players, using what we consider a ‘pilot’ version of our Governance system!



Making up part of those 70 million votes, a staggering 23 million plus Essence was locked up in this voting process, representing more than 14% of the entire circulating supply of Essence at the time. The phenomenal turnout demonstrated the preparedness of Earth 2 Players to not only use and lock up their Essence for something they want, but is also another undeniably strong sign of utility for the token bound commodity.















In the final moments leading up to the selection and locking of the first two most voted on Territories, we witnessed first-hand just what our active community was capable of. With a strong last-minute rally of over 13 million Essence votes being locked towards ensuring that &nbsp; Parnu, Estonia would go down in history as the very first winner of the Player-voted Territories and first to ever be released!&nbsp;&nbsp;







BOOSTED E-THER







Boosted E-ther is first and foremost a massive bonus for all T1 and T2 land holders that is not only visible day-to-day but has the potential to accrue substantially in the size of available E-ther over the course of weeks, months and possibly years. The boost mechanics are applied to all T1 and T2 tiles and these mechanics have been designed in such a way that places full control of the potential benefits into the hands of any Players that own T1 or T2 land.



Every country will have its own unique pool of Boosted E-ther. The amount of Boosted E-ther is determined on a number of factors, including the demand for or popularity of land inside a country based on the New Land Price (NLP), and how many T1 or T2 tiles exist in that country.&nbsp;&nbsp;



The Boosted E-ther mechanics for T1 and T2 tiles function independently from T3 land, that is to say they function without the need of any released T3 Territory in that country. However, there are parts of the boost mechanics which do connect back with T3 land tiles once they have been voted and released inside a country. Once the first T3 tiles are purchased inside a Territory, inside a country, any ‘neglected’ E-ther from the country’s Boosted E-ther pool is distributed among the existing T3 tiles following a few rules.



This mechanism does not take anything away from T1 or T2 landowners, but rather provides an opportunity for T3 land within the same country to lure any excess neglected E-ther from the Boosted E-ther pool before it disperses back into Earth 2 (see The Boosted E-ther Pool&nbsp; + The T3 SEED section of article).&nbsp;



&nbsp;



What is Boosted E-ther and How Does It Work?







It is important to note that Boosted E-ther is only an added benefit to the standard base E-ther a Player would have otherwise claimed for their T1 and T2 tile properties. If a Player misses the opportunity to Boost their T1 and T2 tile properties they are not losing anything, but rather missing out on a bonus boost, so those Players who do not claim in consecutive days are not losing anything, they are just missing an opportunity to get more.



The Boosted E-ther system introduces a significant new update to the Earth 2 land mechanics system and presents an opportunity of benefit to all Players who own T1 or T2 land.&nbsp; It is a HUGE reward for T1 and T2 land holders benefiting those who are active on the Earth 2 platform. As mentioned above, Boosted E-ther is an additional amount of E-ther on top of a Player’s standard E-ther detected from their T1 and T2 properties. It can be obtained simply by claiming E-ther within a 24 hour period every day, through the Claim E-ther button.&nbsp;



Every day that a Player claims E-ther from their T1 and T2 properties, their Mentars slowly become Supercharged which is represented on the Boosted E-ther bar, and continues to supercharge over the course of 30 days, increasing the amount of Boosted E-ther each day.&nbsp;



After 30 consecutive days of claiming E-ther, the boost will have reached its maximum Supercharged boost capacity.&nbsp; For the time being, Players will be able to Boost for the full 30 days and maintain that fully Supercharged Boost. However, in the future there may be limitations on how long the fully Supercharged Boost can be maintained and importantly, there may be ulterior PvP or other game mechanics that could also cause a Player’s Supercharged Boost bar to reset.















Boosted E-ther, including its connection with T3 land, form an important part of the Essence tokenomics system and we anticipate it to be around for quite some time. However, this Boosted E-thersystem, as well as other boost systems that affect the amount of E-ther generation such as Jewel boosts and other boosts, will immediately fall off and cease to function the moment any disinflationary mechanics from the Essence tokenomics system is activated, something we at the very least do not expect to occur for a number of months. It is worth noting that the tokenomics is designed in a way that these systems could also be reactivated depending on certain criteria, but more will be confirmed in the White Paper.&nbsp;







Boosted E-ther Pool + T3 SEED







The Boosted E-ther system is yet another tangible benefit for T1 and T2 land holders, in this case with focus on land with a higher New Land Prices (NLPs).&nbsp; Earth 2 refers to this type of phenomena as the power of “belief”, where benefits will sometimes form inside of Earth 2 as a result of something being more popular or desirable or having greater power or worth, this is something that will be covered in more detail in “What is the Power of Essence?”.



Therefore, the higher NLP a T1 or T2 tile has, the higher Potential Boosted E-ther (PBE) it can attract. T1 tiles have always attracted more Base E-ther Spawn (BES) than T2 tiles. Therefore, while both use the same NLP method to determine the potential E-ther Boost Percentile (EBP), if a T1 and T2 tile have the same NLP, the T1 will ultimately gain more E-ther Boost due to the fact its BES is higher than the T2’s BES.&nbsp;



(EBP*BES=PBE)&nbsp;



The bottom line is that almost all T1 and T2 land will have the potential to receive some form of E-ther Boost, but some potentially more than others depending on three driving factors: T1 or. T2 land, the NLP of the land, and how Supercharged the Mentars are.



Every 24 hours, Earth 2 processes millions of data points to determine the maximum potential E-ther boost per country based on the NLP, number of tiles and T1/T2 tier split of each country.&nbsp; This creates what is known as the Boosted E-ther Pool, a pool which is unique to each country.&nbsp; T1 and T2 land holders have first access to attracting Boosted E-ther from these pools. The amount of Boosted E-ther a Player attracts depends on how many T1 or T2 tiles they own in each country.



Unlike T1 and T2 tiles, T3 tiles do not have the maturity to support Mentars (explained further in the T3 section below). However,&nbsp; T3 tiles do generate, after witnessing that a Player desires them enough to become their first owner, what is known as a SEED, a simple yet undeveloped Mentar form.&nbsp;



Although the SEED does not have the power and capability of a fully developed Mentar, it is still very useful. While it cannot attract base E-ther on its own, one of its special abilities is luring neglected E-ther from the Boosted E-ther pools, that the T1 and T2 properties have failed to attract.&nbsp;



This neglected E-ther is made up of the remaining E-ther from a country&#8217;s Boosted E-ther pool after the Supercharged Mentars on T1 and T2 properties have attracted as much Boosted E-ther as they are entitled to. The T3 SEED is, in fact, so good at luring this neglected E-ther that, depending on how much neglected E-ther is remaining in the pool tile for tile, under the right conditions the lure of the SEED can outperform even the base spawn rate of E-ther on a T1 tile.



However, even T3 SEEDs have their limits and although they can potentially attract more base E-ther than a T1 tile when there is abundant E-ther in the neglected pool, they still have a ceiling meaning that if the neglected E-ther cannot cover the ceiling limit for each T3 tile, then the T3 tiles will in fact compete with one another to attract whatever neglected E-ther is remaining in the country pool which often results in it being evening distributed across all T3 tiles of all Territories in that country.



The result is a battle between T1 / T2 tiles and T3 tiles for the Boosted E-ther pool where the T3 tiles benefit when there are less active Supercharged Mentars in a country, resulting in larger neglected pools of E-ther.&nbsp; Claiming E-ther lured by the SEED of T3 land is, for now, conveniently combined with the main E-ther claim button. If all the T1 / T2 land in an entire country somehow manages to achieve a maximum, 30 day fully Supercharged Mentar on every property then in these extreme circumstances T3 land would have no neglected E-ther to attract.



It is worth noting, that in cases where there is not enough neglected E-ther for T3 tiles to evenly lure, this E-ther does not go to waste but rather accumulates until at least the minimum amount of 0.01 E-ther can be lured by the T3 SEEDs from the Boosted E-ther pool in that country.







TERRITORIES AND TIER 3 LAND







What Are Territories?



Territories are predetermined areas of land where borders have already been set in Earth 1, such as States, Provinces or Counties. They are, for the most part, dependent on or form part of a Country. The introduction of Territories is unlike anything seen in Earth 2 to date in that each Territory release is exclusively determined by the votes submitted by active Earth 2 Players.



When a Territory is voted to be released by the Players, it eventually gets locked into a release queue of Territories (see Territories Release section of article).&nbsp; Only after this process, once a queued Territory is released, does the option for purchasing T3 land appear within that specific Territory .



In the future, Territories may have the ability to operate independently from their country,&nbsp; and governing options like this and many others will ultimately be determined by Players voting through the Governance system (see GOVERNANCE section of article).&nbsp;







What is T3 Land?







Tier 3 land was first officially referenced as a potential base tile in our 2022 birthday announcement where we confirmed that while there were plans to release Tier 3 land at some point in the future, then was not the time and that if we did, it would be for a specific purpose.&nbsp;



That specific purpose is finally revealed as the final foundational component of the land mechanic system that will be documented as part of the Essence tokenomics in the White Paper. It is a critical release that was therefore required in the lead up to the token launch.&nbsp;



Tier 3 Land is the final Tier of land, there will not be a Tier 4. It is the base builder Tier land and although limited in some respects is also quite speculator given its unique ability to lure neglected E-ther from the Boosted E-ther Pools, effectively giving T3 land holders an opportunity to accumulate E-ther and Essence despite T3 tiles being unable to attract E-ther directly from Earth 2 (see Boosted E-ther Pool&nbsp; + T3 SEED section of article).



The timing of Tier 3 land release intentionally coincides with the release of our “pilot” version of the first Earth 2 Governance system, not only providing us with a chance to test this new system but also introduce more utility for Essence linked directly with the final major component of Land mechanics.&nbsp;



Furthermore, with more upcoming major feature releases in the near future, it was critical to ensure this base tile involving new mechanics was live, tested, and fully functioning well before it might be needed by new Players looking to either build inside of Earth 2, or just make a start without mining Resources.



Here are a few key comparisons to consider between the final 3 Tiers of land inside Earth 2:







Tier 3&nbsp;Tier 2&nbsp;Tier 1&nbsp;Tier Purchasing MethodsDirect purchase within Player-released Territories from Earth 2 Map or P2P trading via the Marketplace.Direct purchase from Earth 2 Map or P2P trading via the Marketplace.Unavailable for Direct purchase from Earth 2 Map since July, 2023 (using RE)Available for P2P trading via the Marketplace.Tier Upgrading MethodsUpgradeableUpgradeableNo upgrade available &#8211; already at maximum TierLand ClassesNoneNoneClass 1 to 5E-ther Detection Capabilities&nbsp;None.

T3 Raiding&nbsp;







Tethering of Cydroids and Raiding from T3 properties is possible, although T3 raiding capabilities are different to that of T1 and T2 properties.&nbsp;



Unlike T1 and T2 tiles, T3 tiles require a particular rarity of First Edition Cydroid to Raid other properties. Below is a useful table outlining the size of the property that can be raided based on the tethered Cydroid’s rarity:&nbsp;







Cydroid RarityRaid Target Property Size Limit (Tiles)Common1 &#8211; 25Uncommon1 &#8211; 50Rare1 &#8211; 100Epic1 &#8211; 250LegendaryUnrestricted







This means that, for example, a Common Cydroid tethered to a T3 property can only target and Raid properties with 25 tiles or less, whereas an Epic Cydroid can Raid properties up to and including 250 tiles large.



As the T3 SEED (see The Boosted E-ther Pool + The T3 SEED section of article) is incapable of supporting the building of Cydroids directly, Cydroids tethered on T3 can only be obtained via P2P trading via the Bazaar or via relocation. In this way, Players may purchase or relocate the exact Cydroid and rarity they require based on their property size restrictions and raiding needs.&nbsp;







Obtaining T3 Tiles







Only once a Territory has been locked in via votes on the Governance system and is subsequently released can T3 tiles within that territory become available for anyone to purchase.&nbsp;











The desired tiles can be selected directly from the Grid and if the Territory has been released, the “Buy T3” button will appear as available to make the purchase possible.&nbsp;















T3 Land will also be upgradeable to T2 Land once the Land Upgrade mechanics are released. Players will be able to use Essence to upgrade their Land which contributes to Player-2-Earn mechanics within Earth 2.&nbsp;



The core ideology behind T3 Land is to provide Players with the option of a&nbsp; “base” level tile that includes a level of speculation as to their potential. T3 Land can be used for some things, but its purpose is predominantly to enable a Player to interact with the EcoSim from a building perspective.&nbsp;



The way the system has been designed ensures that affordable base level tiles will be available well into the future as Territories will take years to release. Furthermore, each Territory is independently priced insulating them from major price movements on a Country level.&nbsp;&nbsp;







EARTH 2 GOVERNANCE SYSTEM&nbsp;







The final feature of this major 3-part release, and possibly the most exciting, is the “pilot” version of the Earth 2 Governance system. This system has been designed to&nbsp; place some power into the Players hands initially with the ability to vote and determine the release of Territories, and later expanding to include other matters or issues over time. Such matters may include, but are not limited to, choosing a leader or group of leaders for a Territory, deciding on a set of rules or boundaries within their Territory, setting up trade arrangements, declaring independence, and a number of other interesting possibilities that will emerge.



Additionally, the Governance system brings new utility for Essence, adding to a growing list of uses for Essence inside Earth 2 that will only continue to expand over time. The Governance system will continue to evolve but for now, we invite Players to vote with their Essence and/or Tiles to familiarise themselves with how the system works. Please remember, if you vote with Essence it will be locked up in the vote until that Territory is released!







Submitting a Territory for Voting







Territories become available for voting when they are first submitted by a Player by pledging Essence or tiles they own. The tiles must come from the same country as the territory they are submitting if they choose to submit the Territory with a tile vote.&nbsp;



When a Player submits a territory, they will pledge Essence and/or Land which counts as the first vote towards the territory’s release.&nbsp; It is extremely important to note that the Essence or Tiles pledged to the territory will remain locked until the territory is released.&nbsp;















How To Vote for a Territory Release







Once a territory is successfully submitted, other Players will be able to see the newly submitted territory and decide whether they wish to vote for its release. When voting on a Territory, Players have the additional option to&nbsp; vote on the exact time of day they want the release to take place, allowing them to choose the time of day that is most convenient for them. The votes for time of day release are also aggregated and the time of day with the most votes will determine the exact time the Territory is released on its release day!&nbsp;



Voting with Essence allows anyone with Essence to vote on a Territory release. 1 Essence is equivalent to 1 vote and Players are able to pledge as many Essence votes to a Territory.&nbsp;















Voting with Tiles allows Players who own properties in the relevant country where the Territory exists to pledge their T1 and T2 tiles as votes towards that Territory’s release. Players are free to select the number of available tiles they wish to pledge. This voting option allows those who may not necessarily have enough Essence to vote to still be able to push for territories to be released in the country they own tiles in. Tiles also have stronger voting power compared to Essence; 1 T1 tile is equivalent to 10 votes, and 1 T2 tile is equivalent to 5 votes.















Below is a helpful table detailing the number of votes based on the asset being pledged:&nbsp;







AssetNumber of Votes*Voting CategoryVoting Status1 Essence1TerritoriesAvailable Now1 T1 Tiles10TerritoriesAvailable Now1 T2 Tiles5TerritoriesAvailable Now1 T3 Tile5Future In-Territory Voting&nbsp;Available Later1 T3 Tile2Future Country-Wide VotingAvailable Later



*Number of Votes associated with each digital item and voting category may be adjusted from time to time.&nbsp;



Any Essence and/or tiles that are pledged towards a territory will remain locked until after the territory is released. It is important to note that while voting allows Players to choose which territories will be released first, the territories with the most votes at the end of each Territory lock period will be queued for release while the remaining submitted Territories retain their votes leading up to the end of the next lock period. Given the thousands of territories that could be released, Players should be aware that any pledged Essence and Land may potentially remain locked for many years. The pledged Essence will thereby be locked from gameplay and trading.&nbsp;



So please remember, participating in Territory voting is completely optional and it is always up to the individual Player to decide whether participating makes sense and is appropriate for them. Please carefully consider the length of time your pledged assets could potentially be locked for before deciding to participate. With that in mind, pledged tiles will function normally when pledged, so utility like raiding is still possible from properties with tiles pledged in Territory voting.&nbsp;







Territory Release







Territories are scheduled for release based on the winning territory at the end of each lock period. Initially the locks and releases will occur over several days, but over time these may increase to every 24 hours, and the Territory with the highest votes will be accepted and locked as the winner then scheduled for release in the queue after the release of the previous Territory winner. There is no set number of votes that is required, only that a territory must have the most votes out of all the other territories in order to be crowned the winner. This will continue on with a new winner being determined every several days, until the frequency of deciding winners is changed or all territories are released.&nbsp;



Once a Territory is released, the Essence and tiles locked to that territory will also be released soon after. Players should be aware that the unlocking of Essence and tiles will occur after the territory is released, not when it is locked in and scheduled for release (crowned the daily winner). To easily differentiate which territories are scheduled for release and which are available for voting, the new Territories page displays these sections clearly.&nbsp;



The Territories section at the very top of the page shows the locked territories which have successfully passed the voting round and will show countdown timers to their actual release dates:















The Upcoming Territories section shows the territories which are still available to vote on:















This section is also customisable to display the most relevant information and territories, with toggles to display all your votes, display voting numbers based on number of votes or voting asset quantity (Essence, T1, T2), and filters displaying territories voted by you or territories released to date.&nbsp;







Payment UI Update







In addition to the 3 major feature releases of Boosted E-ther, Territories and Tier 3 Land, and the pilot Earth 2 Governance system, there have also been UI updates to the payment interface when purchasing tiles. This latest update involves a full transition of the payment interface to our signature Dark Mode and, overall, makes it easier for Players to identify details of the property they are purchasing (number of tiles, Tier of tiles, etc.) the payment methods available to them and just looks cool!

Article 101
Title: Resource Release: Uranium
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/11/27/resources-uranium/

====================================================================================================
November 27, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; A highly anticipated resource, Uranium is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system. Uranium is the first of the D8 Resources to be revealed, with only 4 more Resources left to reveal in total. 



We take this moment to remind Earth 2 Players that they will be able to manufacture 2nd Generation Cydroids (2ndGen) to harvest Occurrence Units, however, these 2ndGen Cydroids will not be able to Raid, will not be as performant as a 1st Generation (1stGen) Prospecting Cydroid and will not have all the combined abilities of a 1stGen, many of which have not yet been revealed.



In addition to achieving various levels in the EcoSim in order to build the factories required to manufacture 2ndGens, you may also require at least one 1stGen in order to begin the manufacturing process.



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Uranium (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.

Title: Earth 2 Skins &#8211; Important Details
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/12/03/earth2skins/

====================================================================================================
December 3, 2023 &#8211; Brisbane Australia &#8211; We’re pleased to introduce the Earth 2 Skins store, a place where you can acquire and in the future trade collectible skins of various items to use inside our 3D world, E2V1. Earth 2 Skins function a little differently to standard skin systems, so be sure to read the article carefully as it provides an important introduction about how the Earth 2 Skins “Blueprint” system is designed to work.







The Blueprint System







The Earth 2 Blueprint system will almost always require the Player to have the base item first before they can apply the skin. For example, if the Player has an avatar skin, they will first need a base avatar, or living Earth 2 being, to apply the skin to. In the case of a full avatar skin, this would be a case of having a synthesised avatar to apply the skin to, you would not need base versions of all the various clothing items for a full avatar skin.



Many base items will be discovered, crafted or earned via various game play or a byproduct of the EcoSim inside Earth 2, meaning the Player first needs to do something in order to acquire the base item.  Players will almost always be able to sell skins, but not always base items, however, base items which are a byproduct from the EcoSim will have a higher chance of being tradeable. 



It is important to note that most skins will also have a random chance to drop when the Player is doing certain actions, for example, when the Player synthesises their avatar, there is a chance they will receive a skin during the process. Likewise, if the Player is crafting, building or producing something, there will always be a chance they receive a skin as part of this process.

A few words from Shane about this new system







“Kyung was created by our team using our new character pipeline, all of her clothes and outfit are 100% created by our modellers, her face and body using Z-Brush, Blender and other 3rd party software, animations created by our animator and applied by our animation programmer with a lot of me checking in, keeping across the process and asking for things to be adjusted to get the best look possible and Peter with an technical eagle eye pointing out any issues and ensuring guidelines are followed &#8211; all of this built around a very cool modular character system we’re developing. So we’re really excited about showing her off to the world!”, said Earth 2 Founder, Shane Isaac.



“I was reluctant to launch our skins system too early and I understand some will prefer to wait until the pre-alpha is live, which is fine, but before offering any skins I at least wanted to show the actual 3D model animated and in-engine as opposed to showing 2D concept art which can be misleading, especially when, or if, the 3D model ever gets released or even static 3D models will million of polygons churned out to look amazing but have not yet been optimised and have very little chance to look that good in-game.”



“We are building a Metaverse on a small budget when compared to some of our potential competitors, and while we are more than up to the challenge and have shown impressive progress, it would be inhibiting to think we can never introduce new products or revenue streams. I look at our Earth 2 Skins system as a win-win, where Players get to see the items available for purchase optimised and in a game-ready state, not 2D concept art or billion poly 3D models, and the sales of those items help us to continue building and expanding the team with the end result being our Players getting a better quality product with better looking avatars, items and so forth.”



“Finally, after we’ve refined our character pipeline process and maybe expanded our modeller team, I have a vision where I want to introduce a system where Players can submit requests for full characters or even individual items to be added to the Earth 2 Skin store. I would be looking to use the Governance system to allow Players to vote on which character or item they would like to see added and without any promises, our team would periodically review the top voted submissions and vet possibly accepting it and then developing and listing it on the store! The final decision would be with Earth 2, but if we did select a submission and there were no copyright issues, I will be looking at a system that rewards the owner of the artwork, essentially rewarding artists and creativity, something I feel very strongly about. Aside from these accepted submissions, I also plan to involve the community with choosing names and background stories for official Earth 2 merch characters. I hope all these additional details share a little more insight into my overall vision here”.

Title: Resource Release: Rhenium
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/12/04/resources-rhenium/

====================================================================================================
December 4, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia -Rhenium is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system, with only 3 more Resources left to reveal in total.



We take this moment to remind Earth 2 Players that they will be able to manufacture 2nd Generation Cydroids (2ndGen) to harvest Occurrence Units, however, these 2ndGen Cydroids will not be able to Raid, will not be as performant as a 1st Generation (1stGen) Prospecting Cydroid and will not have all the combined abilities of a 1stGen, many of which have not yet been revealed.



In addition to achieving various levels in the EcoSim in order to build the factories required to manufacture 2ndGens, you may also require at least one 1stGen in order to begin the manufacturing process. 



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Rhenium (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved!&nbsp;



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.



If you missed it, you can check out the announcement about the Resources Overview release here.&nbsp;

====================================================================================================
December 14, 2023- Sydney, Australia &#8211; Prospecting Cydroids, Resources &amp; Prime Jewels. You may have heard these mentioned before, or seen our weekly Resource release announcements. But what are they and what role do they play in the Earth 2 EcoSim?&nbsp;



To understand how Prospecting Cydroids, Resources and Prime Jewels relate to each other, and most importantly, how you will be able to use them in your own EcoSim adventures, continue reading this article! 



Moleh is the last Cydroid to be confirmed for the lower Discovery Tier Resources. With only 2 Discovery Tier 9 Resources and their respective Jewels and Cydroids left to confirm, be sure to look out for the remaining announcements! 



A QUICK RECAP



Resources



Just like our planet Earth, Earth 2 also has Resources that are distributed across virtual land, uniquely based on their geolocation. There will initially be 32 official Resources that will form the foundation for the core building aspect of the EcoSim, 13 of which&nbsp; are still currently available via the E2PRV system.&nbsp;



If you have a specific Resource on your property you will have the ability to mine that Resource by gaining its Occurrence Units(OUs) which will in turn be processed by the Weaver into Raw Materials. Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks required for constructing a variety of Buildings, Factories, Power Cells, Engines (for various types of transportation), Energy Producing Technologies, Advert Billboards, Machinery, Military-Grade Technologies, and more inside Earth 2’s open 3D world, E2V1.



Prime Jewels



As their name alludes to, Prime Jewels have the ability to prime the Resource they are linked to. This can be done by slotting the Prime Jewel associated with the Resource you want to prime into your Mentar. To put it simply, slotting will enable the Mentar to read and collect the specific Resource’s Occurrence Units.&nbsp;



See the full list of released Resources and their associated Prime Jewels below. A new Resource from the chart is released weekly so make sure to keep an eye out for our announcements!&nbsp;&nbsp;







Prospecting Cydroids



Prospecting Cydroids are the product of modifications made to the base model Raiding Cydroids, which have typically been built and used to raid neighbouring properties of their unstable E-ther &#8211; to date. While the ability to modify Raiding Cydroids has not yet been enabled,&nbsp; the revelation of exactly which Cydroids are linked to which Resource/s allows Players to prepare the Cydroids corresponding to the Resources that are abundant on their property/ies.&nbsp;



It is important to note that in order to modify a First Edition (a.k.a. Raiding) Cydroid, you will need to follow a process which involves fusing the relevant Primary Jewel with the relevant Cydroid &#8211; to refresh your memory more information can be found in our previous announcement https://earth2.io/news/major-ecosim-update under ‘Prospecting Cydroids’.



Now with P2P trading of Cydroids in the Earth 2 Bazaar, it is easier than ever to get the Cydroid you need for the Resources you have on your property. Here is a list of all the Resources released to date, including the Cydroids and Jewels associated with Round 1 Resources which are no longer available to claim.

Article 106
Title: Resource Release: Thorium
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2023/12/18/resources-thorium/

====================================================================================================
December 18, 2023 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Thorium is currently available to claim via the E2PRV system. Thorium is the 2nd last Resource to be officially confirmed for the Earth 2 EcoSim with only one more Resource from Discovery Tier 9 left to reveal after that.



We take this moment to remind Earth 2 Players that they will be able to manufacture 2nd Generation Cydroids (2ndGen) to harvest Occurrence Units, however, these 2ndGen Cydroids will not be able to Raid, will not be as performant as a 1st Generation (1stGen) Prospecting Cydroid and will not have all the combined abilities of a 1stGen, many of which have not yet been revealed.



In addition to achieving various levels in the EcoSim in order to build the factories required to manufacture 2ndGens, you may also require at least one 1stGen in order to begin the manufacturing process. 



Earth 2 made a promise in the past that Tier 1 land would receive additional Resources, and that promise starts from Discovery Tier 7. The higher the Discovery Tier, the more advanced the technological product the raw materials will contribute toward. 



Earth 2 has allowed for most of the new Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by any Player. However, after a period of time, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new land rewarding Players who explore and scan inside E2 and these locations may be scarce, meaning that the higher tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



Resource releases are a great opportunity for any Players who own property in Earth 2 and believe they have Thorium (or any active released Resources) present in their land to submit a claim. By making an E2PRV claim, Players can win some Essence and the Resource distributed on their property if the claim is approved! 



To easily see which Resources have been released and whether any of your properties have them, you can check out the recently released Resources Overview tab in your profile page.

The most up to date guidelines on how to submit a valid E2PRV claim can be found in this article, under the Guidelines for Claim Submission heading: https://earth2.io/news/copper-silver-guidelines&nbsp;&nbsp;



Below is a useful table showcasing which Jewels are associated with each released Resource:









*N.B. The CAT have provided a list of approved ores/minerals in order to assist Players in making a valid claim. However, Resource claim validation and Frequency Category attribution is always at the sole discretion of the Earth 2 CAT and there is no guarantee that ores/minerals not confirmed by Earth 2 will be approved. The above list of approved ores and minerals is also not a guarantee of approval, as valid evidence must still be provided and any other criteria for validation must also be met. Please remember that the guidelines set out by Earth 2 are designed to assist and safeguard Players who participate in the E2PRV system. Players should exclusively, carefully and precisely follow official Earth 2 guidelines to mitigate any loss of Essence or Assurance Fees due to submitting an invalid claim. Players who choose to ignore official guidelines do so at their own (and fellow staking Players’) risk.

Title: The Power of Essence
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/01/18/the-power-of-essence/

====================================================================================================




What is the Power of Essence? 



A question many have pondered over time. The simple answer is that the Power of Essence will be largely determined by those who hold it, a liberty placed deeply into the hands of those who own such a vital source of power.



In the ever-evolving Metaverse that is Earth 2, the fluctuation of the Power of Essence is set to become a mesmerising dance, nurtured by the Power of Belief. This term draws parallels from real-world occurrences where the perceived value of an item or commodity is often influenced by the collective belief in its potential and utility. It&#8217;s a concept as old as time, yet as enigmatic as the universe itself— our belief has the potential to shape reality.&nbsp;



Essence is not only a commodity or resource; it&#8217;s also a power with the ability to become a reflection of its owners’ pulse, a dynamic force that rises and falls with the tides of collective conviction. When belief skyrockets, Essence has the potential to soar, pulsating with a surge of renewed power and strength. When belief or desire wanes, its dynamism of energy and strength wanes with it. The phenomena become a gripping spectacle of sentiment-meets-economics, a testament to the power of collective will.



This mystical connection between two parallel realities is not merely an economic principle, but many consider it to underpin the course of Earth 2&#8217;s evolution.&nbsp; An ethereal cycle where Essence is used to create and build by crafting Power Cells to provide energy, and processing Resource Occurrence Units into Raw Materials with a power which waxes and wanes in potency, mirroring the ever-shifting tides of its owners’ belief from an alternate reality.&nbsp;



Therefore, one unit of Essence might shift in power from one day to the next, simultaneously increasing or decreasing the potential charge of every unutilised particle of Essence at that point in time within the ever-evolving Metaverse.



Prepare to be a part of this exhilarating reality, where your belief is not just a sentiment but the source of power that helps fuel the wonder of Earth 2!




“I have been very excited to confirm this locked fiat, adaptable token value system for some time. The system&#8217;s objective is to establish a robust economic basis for all existing and prospective Essence holders inside Earth 2. We needed a simple way to explain this anomaly, so to sum it up in a straightforward manner, we call it the Power of Belief”, said Shane Isaac, Founder of Earth 2.&nbsp;



“In my opinion, many aspiring web3 projects make the mistake of tying token quantity to essential products, items or commodities which are prerequisites for users to have any meaningful experience or hands-on involvement with their platform. This approach results in hyper inflated prices that may make for great headlines when super early token holders decide to splurge, but can subsequently result in blocking the scalability and growth of the project due to the establishment of exorbitant and unrealistic prices that new users face when they want to get involved or become part of its ecosystem”.



“The approach I wanted to take with Earth 2 means we will lock in some values, especially for core facets of the EcoSim such as powering buildings and objects. This will mean tethering an internal measurement unit to a locked fiat figure which can be remunerated using Essence resulting in an adaptable token value system that slides, not only rewarding Players holding Essence if the externally traded price of Essence increases, but incentivising Players actively holding to build and utilise their dynamically empowered Essence inside Earth 2 on the back of such growth”.



“Conversely, under specific conditions Earth 2 may also activate similar mechanisms in response to events where Essence drops below certain external trading points by overriding and increasing the threshold on the internal power of Essence ratio in order to help stimulate trade, encourage building and boost the overall economy”.



&#8220;This overarching design ensures that we remember and reward our early supporters by creating a potential outcome where those who have mined and held onto their Essence can still capitalise, especially if we witness an increase in the external trading value of Essence. Simultaneously, it ensures that new players won&#8217;t encounter significant disadvantages or entry barriers caused by excessively high prices tied to essential products, which could otherwise hinder their participation in the Earth 2 ecosystem.&#8221;



“Many people forget the fact that Earth 2&#8217;s ultimate objective isn&#8217;t merely Essence but rather delivering the ultimate utility to land via a sustainable EcoSim that over time will be used to build infrastructure, deliver experiences, facilitate trade, manufacture digital goods, enable commerce and much more.&nbsp; Essence just happens to play a vital role in this Player driven ecosystem”.&nbsp;
&#8211; Shane Isaac, Founder of Earth 2



Example



The intention behind the following example is to enhance people&#8217;s comprehension of how this system will be implemented within Earth 2. It&#8217;s crucial to emphasise that the figures used below are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as finalised or confirmed ratios or values.



Scenarios



A Blue Level Micro Power Cell requires 1,000,000 Energy Units as part of the crafting process. Let’s assume there is a tethered value of $0.10 USD per 100,000 Energy Units and the current externally traded value of Essence is $0.10 USD.&nbsp;



This would result in 10 Essence being required as part of the crafting process for a Blue Level Micro Power Cell.



Now let’s say the externally traded value of Essence rises to $1.00, therefore, at this point in time it would require 1 Essence to activate and operate the same Blue Level Micro Power Cell.



If the externally traded price of Essence is $0.20, then 5 Essence would be required. If $2.65 then 0.3774 Essence, and so forth.



If the externally traded value of Essence increases higher than the price it was when a Power Cell was originally crafted, it may offer a favourable chance for Players to dispose of their idle and eligible Power Cells, beginning with the most potent, in order to recover the Essence and recraft new ones requiring less Essence for the same strength Power Cell.&nbsp;



Once a Power Cell is crafted with Essence, the ratio remains fixed until the Power Cell is disposed of.



Note: The scenarios mentioned above are provided solely as examples to simplify the understanding of these mechanics. In most cases, when you create and activate a Power Cell with Essence, you will be able to retrieve an equivalent amount of Essence back if you dispose of the Power Cell in a fully charged state. These examples do not encompass the prerequisites for recharging Essence or specific situations in which Essence might be consumed when things like supercharged options are activated.

Title: Archiok &amp; Things To Remember About Earth 2 Skins
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/01/28/archiok/

====================================================================================================
January 28, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; There are many contributing factors that will make up the Metaverse and wearable cosmetics will certainly form one big part. We believe it is important for a contending platform in the Metaverse space to display the capability of creating its own appealing IP, effectively designing and developing a platform other IP brands want to be part of over time, not a platform that is solely reliant on its own existence because of other IP holders.







From concept art to being game ready, Archiok is one example of Earth 2’s ability to conceptualise a unique character that commands a certain presence and aura around it, even though as of yesterday the character was unknown to the world. Archiok is also the first example of a character who will exist inside of E2V1 but can also be worn by Players who own the rights to his skin, albeit for cosmetic purposes as the skin will not grant supernatural powers the real Archiok may possess.









Skins like Archiok are only available for limited times , so be sure to keep an eye out on our socials for new releases or check our skin store from time to time ( https://app.earth2.io/#skins ). It is important to note that our skin store can only be accessed when logged in.







Important Things To Remember About Earth 2 Skins



Since the introduction of Kyung, Earth 2’s first avatar skin made using our own character pipeline, Earth 2 has dropped 2 more highly popular skin collections: the ‘Festive’ collection and the ‘Motorway Marauder’ collection.&nbsp;



These skin collections are part of the overall Blueprint System planned which, to recap, will allow avatar skins and outfit skins to be applied to a base avatar within E2V1. 







For more information on the Blueprint System, read the full article here:&nbsp;



https://earth2.io/news/earth2skins



While the Blueprint System introduces the concept of skins and how they will be used in E2V1, below are some key points we would like to emphasise about the Earth 2 Skin Collectibles leading up to the release of E2V1:







Acquiring Skins



Acquiring skins directly from the Earth 2 official Skin Store or participating in new skin collection drops is completely optional.&nbsp;



If you choose to participate in new skin drops, you will be able to secure the avatar or outfit skin that you like, usually at the once-only discounted price that applies to most of the new skins in these early releases.&nbsp;



It is absolutely fine not to participate in the new skin drops, all Earth 2 Players will still have a percentage chance to acquire skins while synthesising their avatar or participating in eligible EcoSim activities. However, acquiring skins this way is not guaranteed and each skin has a different ‘EcoSim Drop Chance’ that determines the probability of acquiring that skin through the EcoSim. 







Supply



Each Earth 2 Skin may have a different supply limit. If a skin has a supply limit of 3000, this means that only 3000 of that particular skin will be created and be possible to own. Once that supply limit is reached, the only way to obtain that skin will be through P2P trading on the Bazaar.&nbsp;



The EcoSim Drop Chance of a skin is also affected by its supply limit. If a skin has a 2% EcoSim Drop Chance, but the skin has a supply limit that has been reached, there will be 0% chance of obtaining that skin through the EcoSim.&nbsp;



The early skins dropped by Earth 2 leading up to the E2V1 release will more likely be limited in supply. These ‘Limited Supply’ early skins are another way in which early supporters are rewarded with higher rarity of their skins collectibles.‘Limited Supply’ skin drops will become less frequent in the future and will be more frequently replaced with ‘Unlimited Supply’ skins.  Most Unlimited Supply skins will still have a form of restricted availability by requiring Players to wait for the skin to be made available from the Skin Store at certain points through the year, or hope to acquire it via gameplay inside E2V1.







Future Release



It is not our goal to have these early skin drops selling out during their maiden release. Rather it is our intention to provide an opportunity for our early supporters to secure the skins they like at a discounted price and the added benefit of higher rarity through an all-time ‘Limited Supply’ of those skins.







Utility &amp; Customisation



Earth 2 is building a modular clothing system (the Blueprint System) whereby most items of clothing &#8211; especially if sold separately &#8211; will be interchangeable on selected avatars making them more diverse and providing the Player with more ways to spice up their avatar’s outfits to show off in E2V1.



The version of the skin you see in the Skin Store is the base version you receive when you purchase a skin. However, there will be opportunities in the future to tailor outfits in-game, allowing for the adjustment of fabrics, prints, colours, and more.



We understand that fashion has already shown the major part it has to play in the Metaverse so we would like to remind people that while some Players may decide to set rules in the future for certain skins being required for access or as a ticket of entry under certain circumstances, from Earth 2’s perspective these skins are for purely for cosmetic purposes in E2V1.







Exclusively From Earth 2’s Internal Character Pipeline



Earth 2 is proud to have uniquely designed 100% of the skins you see listed in our store and it is important to remember that these Skins are the end result of a long and stringent internal character pipeline we have developed.Each skin starts from concept art which is reviewed and goes through numerous iterations before final approval. Once approved, it is then passed to our 3D modelling team for sculpting into high-poly then into low-poly with further reviews and strict adherence to our pipeline protocols throughout the process. When the low-poly model is finished, the 3D team finalises the model with UV mapping and texture baking, running through their own QA processes during this stage.Once the entire 3D -sculpted model is approved, the models enter the skinning, rigging and weight painting process before being passed on to our animation team for further testing with various animations involving another set of QA such as minimising clipping and identifying any other potential flaws in the model.&nbsp;



The model then goes  through the final process of approval with a game developer to ensure it passes all final tests and is absolutely game-ready for E2V1.







Game-Ready Skins



The above steps only represent a light explanation of our internal character and clothing pipeline to illustrate the processes we have implemented to create game ready skins that are not just static concept art images or a high-poly 3D model that may look nice but lacks any kind of optimisations for application in-game. There is a lot of work that takes place in order to get these skins to the stage where our Players see them in the video footage provided in the skins explainer videos.







Supporting Earth 2



Each Skin sold via the skin store helps support different parts of the development of Earth 2 by providing us with new opportunities to further expand our team, speed up development and keep progressing closer to our short and long term goals for E2V1 and Earth 2.



These Skin drops also give Earth 2 a chance to show off our ability and versatility in avatar, outfit, and accessory creation so even if you’re not keen on picking up a skin yourself, remember to have fun and simply enjoy the progress being shared!



Thanks for reading and remember to keep an eye out for our next official Earth 2 Skin drop!

Title: Retroactive EDC Air Drop for Tier 1 Properties Affected by Locked Countries
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/02/22/locked-countries-edc/

====================================================================================================
February 22, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; We are delighted to officially confirm the retroactive air drop of Essence to the current Landowners of Tier 1 (T1) properties in countries where the sale of T1 land was locked, resulting in repressed New Land Prices for T1 properties in those affected regions prior to the Essence Distribution Commitment announcement on the 3rd of December, 2021. This retroactive air drop, which involves the Essence missed from the original EDC for T1 Landowners, fulfils another one of Earth 2’s promises to resolve the issue prior to the heavily anticipated White Paper and Essence Token launch.



RETROACTIVE ESSENCE AIRDROP



The retroactive air drop of Essence remedies the restricted EDC attributed to T1 properties that were affected by diminished new land purchases prior to and including the 3rd of December, 2021. Today, we are rectifying the reduced EDC attributed to those T1 properties that were impacted by restricted land sales and NLP growth by recalculating the EDC value for these affected T1 properties.&nbsp;



Earth 2 has dedicated a significant amount of time and effort into exhaustively exploring many potential scenarios in order to find the most realistic, probable and workable representation of new land sales and NLP growth in the affected regions. Much care and consideration was taken to construct fair and robust logic behind the solution from our extensive array of property sales data and once all the scenarios were processed we selected the highest possible option available.&nbsp;



As an apology for Players affected by this issue we have decided that all T1 properties affected by restricted NLP growth prior to the EDC announcement will have the recalculated value of EDC Essence credited instantly into the balances of the current owners of the affected T1 properties, removing the requirement of consistently claiming to access the promised Essence.&nbsp;



This is essentially an air drop of Essence which ensures the full amount of Essence is in Players&#8217; account balances prior to the upcoming token release. This air drop method allows Earth 2 to immediately remedy the Essence which has not been available to claim to date while providing the utmost respect to the time that Players have already given to Earth 2.



AFFECTED PLAYERS



Allocating Essence to the current owners of the affected T1 properties best aligns with the original design and purpose of the EDC which was for the Essence to be claimed progressively and required the owner to maintain ownership of their T1 property in order to continue accessing their promised Essence.



Therefore, the retroactive Essence air drop is a special reparation distributed to the current Landowners of T1 properties affected by restrictions to new land sales and, consequently, the growth of New Land Price (NLP) in particular regions.&nbsp;



By the time this announcement is published, the retroactive Essence air drop will have been distributed to all affected T1 properties&#8217; Landowners and will be listed under Essence transactions. 



If you own a T1 property that was affected by a locked country you will receive a notification of the Essence drop under Transaction History &#8211; Essence &#8211; Admin Action &#8211; Locked Country Essence Air Drop for &lt;countryname&gt;.



We would also like to open an avenue of communication for Players who wish to report any unexpected results.&nbsp; If you believe you are missing or have received an incorrect amount for this specific Essence air drop, please submit a support ticket at https://support.earth2.io and include the following information:




Subject line: Retroactive EDC Air Drop



Your Earth 2 Profile / Profile link



Links to the relevant T1 properties you own.&nbsp;



Your expected results based on the above T1 properties which provided the unexpected results.




It is our hope that this retroactive Essence air drop demonstrates Earth 2’s continued commitment to its Players and fulfilling promises made. We extend our sincerest gratitude for your ongoing support, patience, and engagement with Earth 2 and once again apologise to Landowners who were affected by this issue.











Join the journey, shape the future. Earth 2, the People’s Metaverse.

Title: Yellow Energy &#8211; Rewarding Creativity &amp; Contributions to Earth 2! 
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/03/02/yellow-energy/

====================================================================================================
March 02, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 has a small group of passionate content creators who regularly put time and effort toward enriching our community with diverse material tailored to various demographics. Importantly, this material allows people to better understand various aspects of Earth 2, such as how things work, a feature’s background and purpose.



As Earth 2 transitions into its next phase, we thought it would be a gesture of good faith to provide an avenue for these dedicated members of our community to receive potential rewards for their continued efforts making content they would have nevertheless created and released otherwise, while also providing a way for Players to get behind their favourite existing and emerging Earth 2 content creators! We are, therefore, thrilled to officially announce the release of this highly anticipated feature created specifically for Earth 2 Supporters and Content Creators alike: Yellow Energy!



This unique rewards system has been designed to potentially benefit players who have exhibited creativity, effort and dedication on various social media platforms, blogs, podcasts and websites. Yellow Energy will be infused upon Players who create engaging and accurate content pertaining to Earth 2, fostering an informative, entertaining and supportive impact on the community.&nbsp;



To repeat, it is important to note that this system has been designed for people who are existing or aspiring content creators who create high quality content which is easy to digest, entertaining, informative, accurate and engaging. Reach and exposure are factors that will be taken into consideration for some submissions, but our end goal is to help support content creators who fit the guidelines by setting early expectations on what is acceptable and what is not. If your submission is not accepted, do not be disheartened and instead keep improving and try to follow the guidelines better if you wish to take part in the program.



One of our goals here is to ensure content creators are sharing accurate details as we have noticed some content creators do not check facts before sharing information. Furthermore, the Yellow Energy system does not in any way stop content creators from creating and voicing their opinions, and Earth 2 is always willing to listen to various opinions. However, if those opinions contain inaccuracies or were created with the goal of damaging Earth 2, it is hardly reasonable to expect a reward from Earth 2 for such content.&nbsp;Likewise, if a content creator creating positive content that contains inaccuracies will also come under scrutiny for approval.



Our main goal for the Yellow Energy feature is to ensure content creators are sharing accurate details, using this system it will be entirely possible to receive Yellow Energy in return for neutral, high quality and well balanced content as well.







CONTENT CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM



What Is Yellow Energy?



Yellow Energy represents a unique and natural form of emanation from within the core of Earth 2, serving as a token of gratitude and appreciation for those who create content following the system guidelines. It is the newest component of Earth 2’s larger Rewards, Badges and Achievements (RBAs) system. Unlike Red Energy which is obtained through actions of conflict (see Red Energy Announcement), Yellow Energy is obtained through publishing engaging, helpful and supportive high quality content that is easy to digest, entertaining, informative and accurate.



It is clear that Yellow Energy will not be obtainable by everyone, but those who do not obtain Yellow Energy should still consider supporting the concept and the content creators who do make use of it as it will create multiple sources of new material explaining Earth 2, it’s features, purpose and background provides multiple avenues for people to digest and better understand various facets of Earth 2 which is overall better for our platform.



Uniquely, Yellow Energy will be redeemable for Essence at a ratio of 1 Yellow Energy Unit for $0.20 USD of Essence. The Essence will come from our marketing and rewards Essence pool. The redemption period will start between 3-6 months of the official Essence token launch.



How Is Yellow Energy Awarded?



Once a contribution has been submitted via the Content Contributions page on the website, it will be evaluated on its merits by the Earth 2 Team and awarded Yellow Energy based on a series of qualitative and quantitative criteria which follows an internal algorithm used to calculate the final Yellow Energy and Essence rewards. Approval and reward rates should not be taken for granted as they are dynamic and vary based on the contribution&#8217;s platform, format, and Contributor.







YELLOW ENERGY SYSTEM&nbsp;



The Yellow Energy System is a progression-based system which starts at a base Boost of 1 and increases for each associated Title . Titles are determined&nbsp; by the Yellow Energy XPs (reward and penalty points) obtained through content contribution submissions.&nbsp;



TitleBoostYellow Energy Experience PointsNovice10Adept1.252500Advanced1.510000Epic1.7530000Legendary275000Ascended2.25150000Mythical2.5250000Celestial2.75350000Immortal3500000Transcendent51000000



For each contribution that yields Yellow Energy through valid (positive value) or invalid (negative value) submissions, the equivalent value of Yellow Energy Experience Points (XPs) to Yellow Energy is awarded to the Contributor&#8217;s Title. The Yellow Energy System rewards truly dedicated content creators and supporters who regularly make Earth 2 content that fit within the feature framework. As Players gain more Yellow Energy XPs, they progress to higher Titles which in turn apply a higher boost to their submissions&#8217; Yellow Energy XPs.



The Titles of Players who submit content contribution submissions can be seen from the overview of &#8216;Open&#8217; submissions. While lower Titles may not necessarily mean the Contributor is not a true Earth 2 supporter (they may just be new), higher Titles are good indicators of reliable and established Contributors.&nbsp;











Each Title has an associated boost which is applied to the Player’s Yellow Energy reward and XPs. The following is an example of how the boost will determine the final Yellow Energy reward and XPs. Note: The reward values in the following table are EXAMPLES only &#8211; they use DUMMY DATA which should NOT be interpreted as real data.&nbsp;

GETTING STARTED (Creating A Content Contribution Submission)



To earn Yellow Energy and Yellow Energy XPs, Players must submit their original (as in their own) content contribution via the Content Contribution System. Content Creators who share accurate, informative, inspiring or otherwise relevant content that fits the framework of the Yellow Energy feature will be eligible for Yellow Energy.



All that is required to make a Yellow Energy submission is having an Earth 2 account that is KYC verified. Signing up for an account is FREE and getting KYC verified only takes a couple of minutes. If you have issues with setting up a KYC account, you can create a support ticket via https://support.earth2.io/hc/en-us and we will work on other ways to validate your account to submit social content.



If you are interested in making Earth 2 content and earning Yellow Energy but don’t yet have an Earth 2 account, sign up now! Non-content creators can still benefit from the Yellow Energy System by endorsing valid contributions (see ‘Guidelines For Endorsing Contributions’ section below). If you don’t yet have Essence, purchase your first property to start claiming E-ther now: https://earth2.io/news/territories&nbsp;







Submitting a Content Contribution is easy:




Go to ‘Content Contributions’ from your Player menu








Find the ‘Submit Contributions’ button from the ‘Your Submissions’ page.&nbsp;








Complete and submit the &nbsp;&#8216;Submit Contribution&#8217; form. Be sure to provide all the relevant information such as the platform and the format of your contribution, and some text to describe your original content. (See &#8216;Guidelines For Contributors&#8217; for more information)&nbsp;&nbsp;









Remember to stake your Essence at the point of submission creation to avoid missing out.











Guidelines For Contributors (Creating Valid Contribution Submissions)&nbsp;



To create a valid Content Contribution submission, it is first important to keep in mind that the Yellow Energy System is designed for genuine Earth 2 Contributors who have put in time and effort into creating engaging and accurate content pertaining to Earth 2, fostering an informative, entertaining and overall supportive impact on the community. Therefore, there is a standard that is expected and required of the content that is submitted and we ask all Players to be self-critical when considering what they decide to submit.&nbsp;



Contributors may create submissions for eligible content for consideration by the Earth 2 Team. To submit a valid Content Contribution submission, the minimum requirements are:




Contributors must submit their own&nbsp; original content relating to Earth 2, the Earth 2 metaverse, the project or the Earth 2 brand;&nbsp;



Contributors must submit content which has been shared or published outside of Earth 2; and



Submissions MUST NOT contain hateful /offensive / ill-intentioned / spam or otherwise unrelated content. These will be swiftly removed and the Contributor will be penalised.



The content must not have been submitted and approved/rejected before.




&nbsp;To be deemed valid, a submission must meet the above requirements, as well as meet the&nbsp; overall guidelines set for approvable content to receive a positive value (as in more than &#8216;0&#8217;) score on the evaluation criteria.&nbsp;



Content URL: All content submitted must have a valid URL from a valid platform. It must be publicly available and not require any content to be downloaded.&nbsp;



Eligible Platforms: Including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Spotify, Youtube and X. An ‘Other’ option is available for platforms which have not yet been added to the list of available platforms, which will regularly be updated as needed. Not all alternative platforms submitted will be added.&nbsp;



Eligible Formats: Including, but not limited to, video, audio, image and text content. An ‘Other’ option is available for formats which have not yet been added to the list of available platforms, which will occasionally be updated as needed. Not all alternative formats submitted will be added.&nbsp;



Case-by-Case approved content: Content type that is not guaranteed to be approved. Retweets and comments fall into this category. We forsee that the majority of comments and retweets will not be eligible but a select few may qualify because they meet the requirements of content such as a large number of views, likes, comments, etc. We must stress the strict standard with which these will be evaluated and do not recommend this for most players which will also free up our internal team resources to focus on the more relevant submissions.&nbsp;



Endorsement Cap: The number of endorsing players determines how many players may stake Essence to a submission, as well as how much Essence they are able to stake. Less endorsers mean more Essence can be staked and rewarded for each endorser. Influencers or community leaders may wish to communicate with their followers/community to coordinate when they will submit a contribution and how many endorsers they will allow.&nbsp;



Staking Your Essence: At the point of submitting a contribution, Contributors have an opportunity to stake their own Essence to their submission. The stakable amount is determined by the endorsement cap.



Penalties For Invalid Contributions



The Yellow Energy System relies on the honesty and goodwill of its participants. Submissions which are deemed invalid due to being hateful /offensive / ill-intentioned / spam or otherwise unrelated to Earth 2 will be rejected and the Contributor will be penalised with negative Yellow Energy Experience Points, in addition to the a loss of up to 20% of any staked Essence&nbsp; loss which applies to all stakers. This measure is to ensure fairness and uphold the standard of content which aligns with Earth 2&#8217;s values. Repeat offenders may be blocked entirely from creating new submissions to mitigate further losses to innocent stakers.&nbsp;



Therefore, we encourage all Players to adhere to the guidelines provided to foster a respectful and supportive community. Let&#8217;s continue to build Earth 2 as a platform of creativity, positivity, and collaboration.

Guidelines For Endorsing Contributions (Essence Staking)



While Yellow Energy is strictly for Earth 2 Content Creators, all Players have the potential opportunity to reap Essence rewards by endorsing another Player’s valid content contributions. To endorse a contribution, Players will stake Essence to the contribution via the ‘All Submissions’ overview.&nbsp;







When a contribution submission is successfully approved by the Earth 2 Team, the Essence rewarded to all Players who have endorsed a contribution will be relative to the percentage of Essence that was originally staked for that endorsement.&nbsp;



The amount of Essence that can be staked in an endorsement varies from contribution to contribution and is determined by the endorsement cap specified by the Contributor (the Player who created the submission).&nbsp;



All submissions allow a maximum of 1000 Essence to be staked against each contribution. The Contributor specifies how many people can endorse their contribution (from 33 to 1000 people) so the amount of Essence that is required to endorse a certain contribution is the number of endorsers / 1000 total stakeable Essence.&nbsp;



The reward for staked Essence is only given if the submission is approved (granted positive Yellow Energy rewards) and the Essence reward % will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Earth 2 team. We cannot stress enough for supporters not to expect big percentage rewards on their staked Essence. You are supporting content you feel strongly about and believe is relevant and may receive an Essence reward ranging between 1-10% of your staked Essence, if the submission is approved.



NOTE: Submissions that are deemed invalid and receive ‘0’ Yellow Energy rewards will incur a loss of up to 20% of the staked Essence to anyone who endorsed the contribution submission, including the Contributor themself (if they endorsed their own contribution). Therefore, Players who endorse submissions should be mindful and stake their Essence to valid contributions to avoid potential losses and help to strengthen the endorsement system. The exact percentage of Essence loss can range from 0% to 20% and will be influenced by the submission rejection reason.&nbsp;



The purpose of this loss system is to ensure the internal team is receiving correctly endorsed content from the community allowing for the best use of their time reviewing fully endorsed submissions.

Evaluation Criteria



Contributions which are submitted by Players are evaluated against the following criteria:




Performance Metrics.&nbsp;




Performance metrics (views, likes, comments, shares) are used to calculate the base points for the submission.  




Contribution Metrics Endorsement Scores




Contribution Metrics are used to award points based on engaging and accurate content pertaining to Earth 2, fostering an informative, entertaining and overall supportive impact on the community.&nbsp;



This evaluation criteria is a synergy of the different components which define a content contribution through a logical framework to calculate the Yellow Energy Reward for each submission. The Final Yellow Energy Reward for a contribution submission is the sum of the Performance score and the Contribution score multiplied by the relevant boost. Different content formats, such as: Video, Audio, Image and Text are also weighted differently in the scoring system.



Videos and visual submissions done well will often have higher rewards, but in some cases this may also extend to the likes of detailed websites, blogs, software, and so on.







GENERAL SYSTEM HOUSEKEEPING



Approvals and rejections of Content Contribution submissions will slowly begin next week. We ask for patience as our team applies the guidelines to submissions and we believe over time the system will become more streamlined. A brief period of time will be provided for invalid submissions to be removed by the Contributor before approvals and rejections are finalised.&nbsp;



After the first couple of weeks of this system being live, submission evaluation will stabilise&nbsp; and Contributors and endorsers alike should expect a strict standard of evaluation. Contributors also have a reward success rate that is affected by the number of submissions that are approved and every rejection contributes to lowering their success rate which in turn makes their submissions less appealing to endorsers.&nbsp;



Genuine Contributors should also consider adding their Earth 2 Player ID or Profile link to their profiles/channels so that potential endorsers can easily match the content Contributor to the genuine creator of the content.&nbsp;







By introducing the Yellow Energy system where Players can be awarded for existing and future content, we hope to recognise our long term Contributors, as well as encourage emerging content creators and supporters of Earth 2. We look forward to building this incredible community together.



Join the Journey, Shape the Future. Earth 2 &#8211;&nbsp; The People’s Metaverse.







FAQs:



Are Holobuildings included in the Content Contribution and Yellow Energy System?



No, Holobuildings are not included in the Content Contribution system. There will be something else for Holobuilding creators released in the future. However, you may create a submission for posts, images and/or videos which inform or educate people about HBs or the HB features in Earth 2. These will be evaluated on the merits of the post itself, not the craftsmanship of the HB.&nbsp;



Can I submit my entire X profile for evaluation?



No, our team will not approve any submissions for profiles or channels. The content contribution submission must provide a specific and entire content for evaluation, with clear reason and details to support the submission.&nbsp;



Can I submit content in a language other than English?



Currently there is a limitation with accepting content in languages other than English. We will be accepting Korean applications as we have people in our team who speak Korean. We will initially trial submissions in other languages but may restrict the type of content that can be submitted due to the language limitations of our evaluation team.



Are translations of Earth 2 content valid submissions?&nbsp;



It depends on where the translation was published and the audience. We recommend submitting contributions of translations of official Earth 2 content such as articles and announcements. Translations of regular comments will not be accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Do E2-related Polls count as content contributions?



This depends on the purpose of the poll and the poll options. Please consider the contribution value of the poll and whether it offers more than just entertainment before making a submission. Check the Evaluation Criteria for more details.&nbsp;



Are retweets of Earth 2’s or the CEO’s tweets considered valid?&nbsp;



Most retweets will not be considered valid and should not be submitted. However, if the retweet offers more information / insight / original content and can stand on its own merit against the evaluation criteria and has significant engagement or coverage, then it is worth making a submission.



Do memes count as valid content?



No, although they can be entertaining, memes are not eligible content unless they have significant and measurable coverage or engagement.&nbsp;



I was an interviewee in an interview posted on Youtube. Can I submit the interview for content contribution as a participant in the interview?



While we acknowledge a lot of time and preparation can go into an interview from both the interviewer and interviewee’s side, we cannot accept content posted by another person even if you are featured in the video, as we cannot verify the details of your contribution. If you have collaborated with another player to create an interview or video and have both contributed creatively to the content, we suggest you reach a mutual agreement to post the content on your respective pages. Unfortunately, we cannot accept anything else as it takes away from the efforts put in by the interview organiser and video creator themselves.&nbsp;



My contribution that I submitted is not fully backed, should I remove it and resubmit?



No, we do not recommend removing or resubmitting purely based on not having a fully backed submission. Common reasons for why your submission may not be fully endorsed is either because you have set your endorsement cap to 1000 which requires more players to endorse, or your submission is viewed as invalid by other players. If the latter, please review your submission against the evaluation criteria we have shared.&nbsp;



What happens if I endorse a submission made by a Contributor who is not the owner of that content?



There is a risk that you may lose 0-20% of the Essence you have staked to endorse that submission. The Earth 2 evaluation team may be lenient with penalties to stakers to avoid a loss to stakers if they deem the submission to have been submitted in a way which did not make it obvious to stakers that the content was not their original content. However, if the submission is very obviously invalid and staking was done carelessly, no such leniency will be provided and careless stakers should expect to lose Essence from endorsements they give ignorantly.&nbsp;



What happens if someone creates a submission for a content they submitted before?



When this happens, no loss will be given to the endorsers as it is not something they will be able to see. Instead, the Contributor will be penalised with negative Yellow Energy XPs and a rejected submission which will affect their Title and success rate respectively.&nbsp;



Can I make a Content Contribution submission for historic content?



Yes, of course you can. However, you cannot create multiple submissions for the same content, or create submissions for content which have been copied and shared multiple times.&nbsp;



Will YE be tradeable?



No, at this stage rewards such as Red Energy, Yellow Energy and future Energies will not be tradeable but if this changes confirmation will be provided by Earth 2.&nbsp;

Title: E2V1 pre-alpha invites open!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/03/06/e2v1-pre-alpha-invite/

====================================================================================================




March 02, 2024 – Sydney, Australia – Earth 2 is pleased to confirm we are openly accepting early applications for early testing of various aspects of the E2V1 (Earth 2 Version 1) pre-alpha. These applications are being accepted in advance so that when the time comes, we will have a list of willing supporters on hand and ready to help out!









Over the past three years, our dedicated team have poured countless hours into developing the foundations of this pristine, seamless 1:1 scale digital representation of Earth, painstakingly capturing every piece of geolocational data we could source and mapping, modelling, projecting and transcoding that data into 3D visualisation on an earth size scale.



Given the sheer scale of creating a 510,072,000 km² Earth that is not only topographically accurate and performant but also looks visually acceptable is a monumental task in itself which is understandably why most of our development has been heavily focused on this foundation. While still not complete, we have excitingly reached a stage where we can start testing various game mechanics!



Recently, we also reached another major milestone with the early introduction of multiplayer support for E2V1 and started testing the integration of some work in progress game mechanics with the goal of building on and improving the Player experience after the pre-alpha is released. 



A pre-alpha state can mean a lot of things, ranging from extremely early access containing some early game mechanics or proof of concept features to something that is playable but is far from complete lacking fully developed features that function together. 



This invitation does not guarantee we will immediately release the full pre-alpha version to testers, but rather carry out testing for various aspects such as load testing, stress testing or playtesting specific game mechanics when and where needed to help our team fix issues and improve. 



Earth 2 is a massive and ambitious project that we expect to span across many years of development as we build and improve, because we know this is a long term project, we&#8217;d like to at least get something playable into the hands of supporters as early as possible hence the introduction of the&nbsp;E2V1 pre-alpha.



Our long term goals have not changed, the pre-alpha is just the first step toward the creation of the 3D world we have always envisioned and continue along with the ideology of giving our Players &#8216;something to do&#8217; as we build along the way.



You are welcome to sign up for the E2V1 pre-alpha using the link below :

We look forward to seeing you inside E2V1 later this year!

Title: MetaGravity and Earth 2 Partner to Build a HyperScale Interactive 3D Replica of the Earth
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/03/17/metagravity-earth2/

====================================================================================================
San Francisco, CA – March 17, 2024 – MetaGravity, a leading provider of decentralised cloud infrastructure solutions, and Earth 2, the creators of a groundbreaking 1:1 scale, interactive digital replica of the planet Earth, have today officially announced a collaborative partnership. This partnership aims to leverage MetaGravity&#8217;s HyperScale Engine to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability and performance within Earth 2, addressing the unique challenges of multiplayer support for their supermassive, interactive, and geolocational virtual world with the goal to support large scale populations of human players and AI NPCs.



Earth 2: an interactive and playable 1:1 scale virtual Earth



Earth 2 is the world’s geolocational metaverse; an evolving creation of a second virtual Earth that bridges a clear, familiar and relatable link between physical and virtual reality. This innovative approach to the metaverse establishes a direct correlation between locations in the real-world, to locations in the metaverse and our goal is to continuously develop and evolve the pristine 1:1 scale interactive 3D Earth providing people with a massive, open, seamless world to participate in and over time build an alternate reality around our physical existence.



Since launching in November 2020, Earth 2 has grown to become the largest Virtual Land Registry worldwide in size, ownership diversity and value with over 100 million parcels of land sold to date and continues to grow. Three years later we are still here developing and releasing core systems, remaining steadfast in our goal to build Earth 2 as we begin the exciting transition into the 3D world of E2V1 with emerging multiplayer support.



MetaGravity HyperScale Engine: Powering Multiplayer in a Planet-Sized Metaverse



Traditional game engine architectures struggle to manage the immense computational demands inherent to Earth 2&#8217;s expansive and persistent environment, especially when it comes to providing a massive multiplayer online experience on a single sharded server. This is where MetaGravity&#8217;s HyperScale Engine emerges as the solution of choice for Earth 2.



Offering a suite of innovative features, HyperScale Engine is designed to:




&#8211; Surpass concurrent player count limitations with high visual fidelity and density: Not only does HyperScale break through player concurrency limitations, it also proposes to help  Earth 2 maintain high visual fidelity and intricate world detail creating true spatial computing immersion.



&#8211; Reduce server costs: Through dynamic computation allocation, HyperScale Engine has the potential to deliver superior cost efficiency



&#8211; Easy to use: HyperScale Engine has the capability to  integrate with Unity 2023 (HDRP), a development workflow Earth 2 is extremely excited to try out.




A Partnership for an Unbounded Digital World



This collaboration empowers Earth 2 to vastly improve on their existing inhouse multiplayer system and achieve the following:




&#8211; Scale high fidelity player avatars with complex physics interactions anywhere in the world, enabling users to explore, interact, and encounter various experiences across their  vast digital landscape.



&#8211; Support large-scale community-based minigames: Achieve never before seen levels of multiplayer inside a world-scale replication, 




This partnership signifies a significant step forward for the evolution of the metaverse, paving the way for unprecedented levels of scalability, performance, and immersive player experiences within a supermassive and geographically-accurate digital reality.




“Earth 2&#8217;s ambition to build a hyper-realistic, interactive digital Earth aligns perfectly with our vision of powering the next internet. Our HyperScale Engine is uniquely positioned to help drive Earth 2&#8217;s vision for the most immersive 1:1 replica of the earth, including all of the potential immersive and realistic qualities that inhabitants will experience within this metaverse. The scale and fidelity of this experience needs to be unprecedented for game worlds and simulations and we are excited to build this new reality together with the Earth 2 team. This partnership is exciting because it pushes the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in a shared, persistent online world.”
Rashid Mansoor, CEO &amp; Founder of MetaGravity




“Throughout 2023 Earth 2 quietly worked on our own multiplayer system, designed to facilitate group experiences for Players inside Earth 2 Version 1 (E2V1) during the pre-alpha phase. During this time we&nbsp; maintained contact with some of the more known network solution providers in the gaming space to ensure we were in touch and ready for the integration of any cutting-edge technology as it became available.&nbsp;Without becoming complacent, we also monitored the space for new faces in the industry when MetaGravity emerged to us late last year as a beacon of innovation, immediately capturing our attention with their groundbreaking networking solutions.The brilliance of Rash and the MetaGravity team is evident in their unique approach to concurrent massive multiplayer and spatial online gaming. Collaborating with individuals ranging from their top-level executives to every member of their team has been a revelation, as we discovered a collective of highly skilled and forward-thinking individuals dedicated to achieving the pinnacle of multiplayer networking.This newly formed partnership heralds an exciting chapter for Earth 2, as we join forces with MetaGravity to push the boundaries with their Hyperscale Engine in our massive, open and seamless 1:1 scale pristine version of the planet Earth.”
Shane Isaac, CEO &amp; Founder of Earth 2

Title: Earth 2 at GDC 2024!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/gdc-2024/

====================================================================================================
Earth 2 is thrilled to announce our official attendance of GDC 2024 which will include public access to a build of Earth 2 Version 1 (E2V1) for people to play with. In conjunction with MetaGravity, Earth 2 will have a booth demoing E2V1 between Meta and Unity in the main entrance and busiest section of the exposition.&nbsp;



E2V1



The main focus of the E2V1 build at GDC is to demonstrate that we have in fact developed the foundations of a seamless 1:1 scale digital Earth &#8211; and what better place to show this than at the global game industry’s premier annual event.



People will have the freedom to navigate the 510,072,000km2 digital Earth, zoom in and out from and to anywhere in the world, from space down to flowers and grass all seamlessly in real time.&nbsp;



Though still in a very early stage, the core purpose of showcasing E2V1 at GDC is to demonstrate how we have successfully developed the early foundations for the digital Earth we set out to build from the very beginning. The digital Earth we will be working with MetaGravity to Hyperscale its multiplayer capabilities.



In addition to this already impressive piece of foundational software, we are also going to include a few other things in the demonstration, all in real time :




ability to move anywhere in free camera mode



ability to spawn avatar anywhere



ability to toggle avatars



ability to spawn and use cars, boats, Cydroids and the jet spaceship



ability to show and hide the grid, including flags and ownership



ability to change atmospheric density and colour tint&nbsp;



ability to initiate satellite overlay anywhere in the world



ability to enable fish, spawn campfires, enable fog, depth of field and so forth



teleportation to over 20 various biomes



ability to change seasons



ability to change wave levels



ability to change day cycles



target practice mini game with rifle and rocket launcher with scores



E-ther mini game with scores



plus a whole bunch of other little things, but most importantly the ability to spawn beach balls!




If you happen to be in San Francisco, or attending the GDC event, be sure to come visit the Earth 2 booth and MetaGravity at Stand S927, right between Meta and Unity &#8211; you can’t miss it!&nbsp;



GDC, which stands for the Game Developers Conference, is the game industry’s premier professional event. It brings together game developers and advances their craft through education, inspiration, and networking.

Title: Supercharged E-ther For Earth 2 Day!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/04/24/earth2day2024/

====================================================================================================
April 24, 2024 – Sydney, Australia – Earth 2 Day was first introduced in 2022 to coincide with global Earth Day. To continue on the tradition from last year, we will celebrate&nbsp; #Earth2Day once again by rewarding our active Players. Therefore, from UTC 00:01 April 23, 2024 to UTC 00:01 April 24, 2024, Earth 2 will become ‘supercharged’ in acknowledgement of #Earth2Day, resulting in an increased spawn rate of E-ther by 300%!&nbsp;It may also have a surprising effect on Resource generation too!



It is extremely important to note that this supercharged E-ther spawn will take place in the UTC time zone which means it may happen at different times or days depending on the timezone you are located in. Please also be aware that this is a supercharge to the E-ther spawn, so there is no supercharge on the E-ther Boost, Boost Pools or T3 land (directly) &#8211; therefore many will not necessarily see a 300% increase to their daily claimed E-ther, but only to the T1/T2 spawned portion of their claim.&nbsp;



This increased E-ther spawn will be subject to the standard E-ther rules, remaining stable for 24 hours once detected by the Mentar, giving the owner that period of time to claim their E-ther before it becomes unstable and able to be raided by others! This is also a great time for active Raiders to pick up increased E-ther from inactive Players&#8217; lands.&nbsp;



So don&#8217;t miss out and remember to log in and claim your bonus E-ther today!&nbsp;



&nbsp;Essence First Step &#8211; connect your MetaMask Wallet&nbsp;



As part of Earth 2 Day 2024, we are also excited to announce the release of the first important step leading up to the highly anticipated launch of Earth 2’s own utility token: Essence.



Wallet Connection is a new and important feature which will enable you to transfer the Essence tokens you have earnt within Earth 2 out onto the Ethereum Blockchain. We are releasing this feature now in order to give our Players ample time to connect their wallets and for our team to ensure everything is functioning correctly before we look at releasing the next important step.

Title: Introducing the Earth 2 Land $ESS Upgrade System
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/06/23/ess-land-upgrade/

====================================================================================================
June 23, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to introduce the Earth 2 Land Upgrade system, powered by Essence ($ESS). This article is being released prior to deployment in order to give Players some time to understand the basics around how the system will work. At first glance it is a simple system which importantly requires Essence ($ESS), or a combination of Essence plus an energy type, to infuse your land with a sudden burst of power through the Mentar resulting in a permanent upgrade to that property. However, the careful design of this system creates a number of key variables which Players will need to take into consideration.



Increased Utility for $ESS and the Land Upgrade System Introduction



Essence ($ESS) already has a number of important Utility cases on the Earth 2 platform, such as:




&#8211; Building Cydroids



&#8211; Powering Cydroids



&#8211; Crafting Jewels



&#8211; Voting



&#8211; Staking on Resource Claims



&#8211; Staking on Yellow Energy Claims




Over coming weeks, months and years, Earth 2 plans to continue expanding on the Utility of Essence, ultimately increasing its usefulness and purpose inside of Earth 2. The Land Upgrade system is the first of many such examples, and will provide a Utility where the Essence utilised is not only spent, but will also introduce a new burn mechanism.



The amount of Essence or Energy required to upgrade land is determined by two major factors: the popularity or demand for land within a country or territory which is reflected by the New Land Price (NLP), and the external trading price of Essence. These two main factors should be taken into consideration when upgrading your land in order to determine whether it is a good time for you to upgrade, or not, in a specific country.



While some locations may be ripe for upgrades based on the&nbsp; externally traded price of Essence, once the Land Upgrade System officially comes online many locations may take months or in some cases years before a Player may consider the upgrade viable or beneficial.&nbsp;



Another important factor to consider is the varying popularity of land within a country or territory after upgrades are initiated by Players, as these upgrades can directly affect the NLP of each Tier by causing it to rise or fall as the numbers of tiles allocated to each Tier is automatically adjusted as a result of each upgrade. This means the NLP can increase or decrease depending on the collective upgrade activity from Players.



As part of a special campaign celebrating the Land Upgrade System, the first 25,000 tiles of each upgrade method (collectively 125,000), upgrading from Tier 2 to Tier 1 using one of the 5 upgrade methods available (Essence alone, Essence + Red Energy, Essence + Yellow Energy, Essence + Blue energy and Essence + Green energy), per country, will receive a permanent 5x boosted base E-ther spawn on their newly upgraded Tier 1 Special property. For the record, the base E-ther spawn rate equals whatever the spawn rate is on T2 land. Once these special boost upgrades have been allocated, all subsequent T2 to T1 upgrades will proceed as normal.

The Land Tier Upgrade System &amp; What It Means For Landowners



The Land Tier Upgrade system is a dynamic system that will allow Landowners to upgrade the ‘Tier’ attribute of their virtual land in order to unlock or access the benefits that higher Land Tiers may bring. It is important to understand the benefits and restrictions of each Land Tier, as well as the costs associated with upgrading, in order to determine whether upgrading is suitable for you and your unique virtual land ownership experience. There may be cases where higher Tiers are not always worth upgrading to at certain times based on the Tier attributes and the upgrade costs so please check the following Tier attributes table and continue reading to find out more.&nbsp;

In addition to the benefits and restrictions illustrated in the above Tier comparison table above, the function of upgrading land in itself involves important restrictions to be aware of:




Land may only be upgraded, never downgraded;&nbsp;



Land may only be upgraded 1 Tier at a time; and




Upgrade OrderT3 -&gt; T2T2 -&gt; T1




Tier 1 is the highest upgrade possible.&nbsp;




Impact on New Land Price (NLP)



The Land Upgrade system will set in motion dynamic changes to the NLP of every Tier of land in Earth 2. As tiles transition from a lower tier to a higher one, the total number of tiles in each tier will change following each upgrade. This can and will affect the rise and fall of NLPs for the first time ever in each Tier within the same territory (T3) and country (T1 and T2) as tiles are upgraded from one Tier to another. The constant fluctuations of NLPs for each Tier, as well as the external trade price of Essence will provide an array of various strategies and opportunities related to land acquisition.&nbsp;



The Land Upgrade Cooldown Feature



A number of our Players were concerned about competition and bots being used for land upgrades. For this reason, our team developed a cooldown feature that will be activated for the first 48 hours after the Land Upgrade system is released. The cooldown period will be set to 5 minutes for the first 48 hours and will be applied per country. This means once you upgrade a T2 or T3 property inside a specific country, you will not be able to upgrade another T2 or T3 property inside that country for another 5 minutes. You may, however, upgrade T2 or T3 properties in other countries while you wait, subject to the same cooldown rules.



After 48 hours, the cooldown timer will be reduced to 10 seconds or otherwise completely removed.



The Land Upgrade Essence Burn Mechanism



For every&nbsp; Essence used by Players to upgrade their properties, 50% will be transferred to the Earth 2 Treasury and 50% will be permanently burned. These burns will take place at various intervals and can be validated via the official smart contract. We may also post about burns on social media to keep Players up to date.



Tier 1 Classes – A World of Opportunity



Upgrading from Tier 2 to Tier 1 is not just a simple upgrade. Upgrading to Tier 1 means that your property will adopt the Tier 1 class based on the number of Tier 1 tiles currently owned in the country at the time of upgrading, contributing to the total supply for that class.&nbsp;



Class Benefits (Tier 1 ONLY)Occurrence UnitsYes, higher classes get higher resource saturationEPLsClass 1, 701+ Tiles: 4 CharactersClass 1, 601-700 Tiles: 5 CharactersClass 1, 451-600 Tiles: 6 CharactersAll other classes and tile property sizes: 7+ Characters



Upgrade Methods– Essence and Energy&nbsp;



The amount of Essence and Energy (if using Energy) required to upgrade your property to a higher Tier is calculated differently depending on whether there is a positive or negative price gap between the Tiers you are upgrading to and from. It is important to note that presently Red and Yellow Energy have been released on the Earth 2 platform, other energy types such as Green and Blue will be acquireable through other methods at a future date.







Example image shows a positive price gap between Tier 2 and Tier 1.&nbsp;



When there is a positive price gap between the current Tier and the Tier you are upgrading to (typical scenario), the formula used to calculate the upgrade cost is based on the NLPs of each Tier:



Upgrade Cost (Tier 2 to Tier 1) = ((T1 NLP &#8211; T2 NLP) * No. of Tiles Upgraded) / Essence Fx USD Rate



EXAMPLE ONLY:&nbsp;



If Essence = E$0.50 , T1 NLP = E$0.11 . T2 NLP = E$0.10 , Property Size = 182 Tiles



Example Upgrade Cost = ((E$0.11 &#8211; E$0.10) * 182) / E$0.50



  = 3.64 Essence (approx. E$1.82)&nbsp;







Example image shows a negative price gap between Tier 2 and Tier 1.&nbsp;



When there is a negative price gap between the current Tier and the Tier you are upgrading to (atypical scenario), the formula used to calculate the upgrade cost is based on the number of tiles you are upgrading:&nbsp;



Upgrade Cost (Tier 2 to Tier 1) = No. of Tiles Upgraded * 0.1 Essence&nbsp;



Upgrade Cost (Tier 3 to Tier 1) = No. of Tiles Upgrade * 0.03 Essence



EXAMPLE ONLY:&nbsp;



If Essence = E$0.50 , T1 NLP = E$0.15 . T2 NLP = E$15.25 , Property Size = 182 Tiles



Example Upgrade Cost = 182 * 0.1&nbsp;



  = 18.2 Essence (approx. E$9.10)&nbsp;



To see how much your T2 and T3 properties cost to upgrade, go to your portfolio or property detail page and select the ‘UPGRADE’ button.&nbsp;







The current ‘View Only’ Land Upgrade interface will display the upgrade cost based on current NLPs for positive price gaps. For negative price gaps, there is no example cost provided as the official external price for Essence is not yet connected.. Players may check potential cost scenarios using the editable data field for hypothetical Essence rate conversions:







The amount of Essence required to upgrade tiles can be partially subsidised using Energy as a substitute for some of the Essence. The total Energy discount capacity (how much of the total upgrade cost can be subsidised using Energy) is dependent on the tier of land that is currently being upgraded from:&nbsp;



T3 to T260%T2 to T130%



Note that the discount capacity is shown in percentages. Players may choose a discount percentage lower than the capacity depending on how much Energy they have in their balance.&nbsp; As the external trade price of Essence varies, so too will the amount of Energy required to subsidise the Essence cost to upgrade, which is why the discount capacity is set as a percentage rather than a set price.&nbsp;



A Special Upgrade-to-T1 Campaign: Boost Your Experience&nbsp;



To celebrate the new Land Upgrade system we will be running a special Upgrade-to-T1 Campaign. This event will give a unique and special permanent 5x boost to the base E-ther spawn on the first 25,000 Tier 2 properties upgraded to Tier 1, per country, per energy type upgrade method:&nbsp;







This means that 25,000 special boost tiles are allocated per Essence, and Essence + Energy upgrade method in each country, totalling 125,000 tiles per country. If upgrading using Essence PLUS an Energy, the full Energy discount capacity (30%) must be used to be eligible for the event. Upgrades which use only the partial but not the full (i.e. &lt;30%) discount capacity will not be eligible for the special boost.



By checking the Land Upgrade interface, you will immediately be able to see if upgrading your property will result in a Special Tier 1 property, indicated by the Special Tier 1 icon and gold text colour:&nbsp;







You will also be able to check how many Special Tier 1 tiles are still available for allocation for each of the upgrade methods:







It is very important to note that if, for example, there are only 100 Special Tier 1 tiles available for the ‘Only Essence’ upgrade method but you are upgrading a Tier 2 property with 500 tiles, using this upgrade method is still possible but will not result in a Special Tier 1 upgraded property with access to the 5x boosted E-ther spawn boost. So be sure to check the number of Special Tier 1 tiles that are available for the property size and upgrade method you are hoping to use before proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;



This special Upgrade-to-T1 campaign is only applicable to Tier 2 to Tier 1 upgraded tiles and applies regardless of the positive or negative price gap scenario between Tier 2 and Tier 1 NLPs. However if upgrading in a negative price gap scenario (i.e. Tier 2 NLP is higher than Tier 1 NLP) only the ‘Essence Only’ upgrade option is available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



The Land Upgrade Function



To access the Land Upgrade interface (currently in View Only mode) simply navigate to the Portfolio page or the Property Info page . Upon selecting the ‘UPGRADE’ button, you&#8217;ll be presented with detailed information regarding the cost to upgrade your property, the benefits of the upgrade, and even potential discounts available for your upgrade.







Land Upgrade Interface (View Only state)



Selecting the ‘?’ tooltip will reveal the benefits of upgrading the selected property, for your convenience. 







Benefits of upgrading from Tier 3 to Tier 2







Benefits of upgrading from Tier 2 to Tier 1



If using a combination of Essence and Energy to upgrade your land, the amount of Essence and Energy required is automatically calculated based on the external trade price of Essence and the amount of Essence you wish you to discount (maximum discount rates dependent on the Tier of land you are upgrading from).&nbsp;



To check the Energy discount calculation in the current ‘View Only’ state, simply enter a hypothetical Essence conversion rate price in the input data field.&nbsp;







For this example only, we have set the hypothetical external trade price of Essence to E$1.00.



Based on a positive price gap to upgrade from Tier 3 at E$0.10 / tile NLP to Tier 2 at E$5.93 / tile NLP, the total cost to upgrade this property to Tier 2 is calculated to be 372.8600 Essence.&nbsp;







Using the slider or input data field to enter the total Essence discount, the amount of Essence and Energy required for the upgrade is calculated:







When the external trade price of Essence changes, from E$1.00 to E$0.50 for example, the amount of Essence and Energy required for the upgrade will adjust accordingly:&nbsp;







While this new system will remain in a View Only state until Essence is externally tradeable, Players may use the interactable Essence to USD value conversion tool to test out various price scenarios for the properties they are hoping to upgrade, in preparation for what the price of Essence and the consequent upgrade costs may be.&nbsp;



Land Upgrade Slippage



We have allowed for up to 1% positive slippage when upgrading land. This means that in the case of Land Price volatility, the charged amount may be up to 1% higher than the price shown to you in the upgrade screen. The purpose for this slippage is to avoid excessive upgrade failures, especially in popular areas at various times.



If the price increases more than 1%, the upgrade will fail and you can try again.



It is important to note that this slippage system only applies to a cost increase, if the charged amount is lower than shown the upgrade will always go through.



The same applies for special Campaign tiles, if T1 Special Campaign tiles run out before you confirm your upgrade, the upgrade will fail and you will need to try again.



Elevate Your Earth 2 Journey



The Land Tier Upgrade system will provide Players &#8211; specifically Landowners- the ability to control their journey and explore the potential benefits of this upcoming upgrade system.&nbsp;



Please remember that the Land Tier Upgrade system is currently still in a view-only state. As many from our community already know, the external trading of Essence is now live, but even though we have implemented a cooldown timer, there will be no countdown for the Land Upgrade system, it could come online at any time and without warning to avoid parts of our website potentially crashing due to high demand. The only guidelines we can provide our community is that it is scheduled to come online any day this week at a time between 8am-2pm UTC when our devs and QA are on standby.



In the meantime, you can continue preparing to upgrade your properties by raiding to earn E-ther (for Essence) and Red Energy, or create meaningful Earth 2 related content to earn Yellow Energy (read more about YE here)!&nbsp;

Title: ESSENCE Utility Boost via the Earth 2 Skin Store
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/06/29/ess-utility-e2-skins/

====================================================================================================
Earth 2 to Expand $ESS Utility via the cosmetic Skin Store



June 29, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is thrilled to announce another new addition to the utility of Essence ($ESS) through the introduction of the ability to purchase selected skins from the Earth 2 Skin Store. This development aligns with Earth 2&#8217;s long-term vision to expand the utility and purpose of Essence within the Earth 2 platform. It also rewards Players holding Essence on the platform as they will gain access to exclusive deals, unique items, and more, often at discounted prices.



The importance of customisable appearances in gaming is well-established. It allows Players to express their identity, emotions, and even indulge in a form of escapism by adopting different personas while standing out from the crowd. The gaming skin industry alone is valued at a staggering $50 billion. In the Metaverse, where social interaction, creativity, and individuality are paramount, the ability to alter one&#8217;s virtual appearance is even more critical. Custom-created by our concept artists and 3D team, including community submitted designs, Earth 2 Skins provide the ideal solution for enhancing Player’s metaverse experience into a more immersive, unique and memorable one.



As outlined in our Whitepaper, Earth 2 has also designed a system that supports the adaptive value of Essence at various times and places. We are pleased to announce that this system will be applied to certain items in the Earth 2 Skin Store, meaning $ESS holders who purchase skins will sometimes be able to acquire those skins at lower, more attractive prices.&nbsp;



Three Types of Skin Listings



Under this new system, there will be three types of skin listings available in the Earth 2 Skin Store:



$ESS Exclusive Listings



The first category includes skins that can only be purchased with $ESS. These exclusive listings will not be available for purchase with E$. There will be two sub-categories within these listings:




Prices tied to the external USD value of $ESS &#8211; in this case a USD value will be set for the item and linked to the external trading price of $ESS meaning the $ESS amount could fluctuate based on external trading behaviour.



A Predetermined price of $ESS set by Earth 2 &#8211; in this case Earth 2 will set a static $ESS price for the item, not a set USD price, meaning that irrespective of the external trading price the $ESS amount will be fixed.




Hybrid Listings ($ESS and E$)



The second category features hybrid listings, allowing purchases with either $ESS or E$. For these skins, two separate purchase options will be available: one using $ESS and the other using E$. For instance, in a Limited Edition Skin release of 500 units, 450 units might be available, with 225 units listed in $ESS and 225 in E$. This ratio is flexible and can be adjusted, such as 100 units in $ESS and 325 in E$, or 400 units in $ESS and 25 in E$.



E$ Exclusive Listings



The third category is the traditional E$ only listings. This familiar listing style will continue to be available for many skins. However, exclusive E$ skins will often cost more when compared to $ESS skins, as $ESS skins will frequently, but not always, be offered at a discount specially for $ESS holders.



Closing Thoughts



The $50 billion cosmetic skin industry is massive and Earth 2&#8217;s introduction of $ESS as a purchasing option for its custom-made skins marks a significant step in expanding the utility of $ESS, not only in the short-term but also in the long-term.&nbsp;



In addition to this initiative enhancing the utility of $ESS, it also provides Players holding $ESS with greater flexibility and exclusive opportunities within the Earth 2 platform. By allowing purchases with $ESS, Earth 2 will at times provide an opportunity for participating Players to acquire items at a potentially lower USD value, making it an attractive option for those who hold $ESS and want to secure such items when they become available.&nbsp;



To celebrate the launch of this new feature, Earth 2 will be setting static prices on SOME selected skins at a rate of $0.15USD per $ESS. This would mean a E$15.00 skin would be sold for 100 $ESS.&nbsp; It is important to remember that some skins will still be listed in E$.



Keep an eye out for our next skin drop if you’d like to pick up a few special skins for the very first time ever using $ESS!Hint: If you&#8217;d like to deposit your $ESS back into the Earth 2 Platform to purchase items like skins, please login to your free Earth 2 account and follow the instructions on the Settings page.

Title: Earth 2 Players Spend Over 12 Million Essence on Land Upgrade Launch
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/06/30/land-upgrade-burn/

====================================================================================================
Historic Day for Earth 2: Unprecedented Spending and Utility of $ESS



June 30, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia- Earth 2 players have showcased remarkable engagement with the platform, spending over 12 million Essence on the first day of the Earth 2 Land Upgrade system launch on Tuesday, June 25, 2024. The exact amount, 12,257,101.6727 $ESS, equates to an impressive $1,041,853.64 USD based on the current externally traded price. This marks the largest single-day spending on land alone since early 2021 and provides a glimpse at the robustness of $ESS utility within the Earth 2 ecosystem.



A Milestone for $ESS Utility



As outlined in the Earth 2 Whitepaper, the platform has created a system that often interlinks with the externally traded value of Essence. The substantial spending of Essence on land upgrades demonstrates the growing importance and practicality of $ESS in the Earth 2 metaverse. This surge in utility not only reflects the increasing confidence of Players in the future of Earth 2 and of Essence, but also highlights Earth 2&#8217;s innovative approach in creating a vibrant and engaging digital economy.



Special Celebration: Double Burn of $ESS



According to the tokenomics outlined in the Earth 2 Whitepaper, 50% of the $ESS spent on land upgrades is to be burned, while the remaining 50% is to be allocated to the Treasury. However, to commemorate the successful launch of the Land Upgrade system, Earth 2 has decided to burn its rightful share of the $ESS as well. This means an additional 6,133,105.8363 $ESS, equivalent to $520,926.82 USD, will be burned. 



Therefore, 12,257,101.6727 $ESS, over 1.2% of the Maximum Supply of 1 billion, will be burned during this event!



This special gesture not only enhances the scarcity of $ESS, but also shows Earth 2&#8217;s continued commitment to rewarding its community, landowners and $ESS holders. 



The Impact of Land Upgrades



The introduction of the Land Upgrade system has allowed Players to unlock more utility and performance on their properties, creating more potential long term value and functionality within the Earth 2 platform. This new feature is a significant step forward and its immediate and enthusiastic adoption reflects the community&#8217;s readiness to embrace new opportunities within the platform as it evolves.&nbsp;



Final Thoughts



The unprecedented spending of over 12 million Essence on the first day of the Land Upgrade system launch marks a historic moment for Earth 2. This event not only underscores the significant utility of $ESS but also demonstrates the strong engagement and commitment of the Earth 2 community. By burning an additional share of $ESS, Earth 2 has further solidified the value and scarcity of the $ESS utility token.



As Earth 2 continues to innovate and expand, the platform remains dedicated to providing its Players, land holders and $ESS holders, with unique opportunities. The success of the Land Upgrade system is a testament to the platform&#8217;s potential and the vibrant future that lies ahead. We thank our supporters for embracing these new developments and continuing to be a part of the evolving and dynamic world of Earth 2.

With more plans from Earth 2 to release new features and systems which not only expand and improve the Earth 2 EcoSIm but continue to add size and dimension to the utility of Essence ($ESS), Earth 2 Players can look forward to future updates that are not only useful but often rewarding as they continue their Earth 2 journey.&nbsp;



Other Updates



YELLOW ENERGY



Essence+Yellow Energy Land Upgrades will be going live next week&nbsp; as the Content Contributions evaluation team will begin to wrap up claims that have been marked for rejection. There are still some open submissions we plan to approve, but as always, we urge Players with claims to review their submissions based on the guidelines shared in the previous announcement (https://earth2.io/news/yellow-energy) before making any new submissions.



Importantly, Earth 2 will process this first batch of rejections with 0 Yellow Energy XP penalties and 0 Essence penalty rates. However, moving forward, Players can also expect to see an improvement in the Yellow Energy system whereby claims will begin to move to “Under Investigation” status and then either to “Approved” or “Rejected” status shortly after. We hope this will allow Player’s Essence to be freed up from staking relatively quickly and assist with improving the quality and credibility of the overall Content Contribution&nbsp; submissions.



E2V1 PRE-ALPHA TESTING



First round notices for E2V1 Pre-Alpha Tester invitations are also expected to be sent out over the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, please visit our youtube page (https://youtube.com/c/earth2) and Earth 2 CEO’s X page (https://x.com/theshaneisaac ) for footage and sneak peaks of E2V1 progress. Most recently, we have shared footage of megacities, tile art and popular locations to showcase the amazing community initiatives that can be seen in E2V1.&nbsp;

====================================================================================================
July 26, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is pleased to present a recent $ESS token statistics update from the past 30 days, detailing daily usage for Land Upgrades, Cydroid construction, and Skin purchases.



All dates below are in UTC.







Key Totals are:




Land Upgrades: 4,642,500 $ESS



Cydroid Construction: 115,842 $ESS



Skin Purchases: 851,932 $ESS




The above totals resulted in 3,289,024 $ESS being earned by the Treasury and 2,321,250.2871 $ESS being burned forever!



With a total of 5,610,274 $ESS being spent on the platform over the past 30 days at an average of 187,000 $ESS per day, Players are currently spending 196% of the average daily Essence being mined by Players (95,000 $ESS).



Please note, these totals do not include $ESS used for crafting Jewels, which will be covered in a separate update. We will also be releasing another update on the precise figures of $ESS mined, including the symbiotic mined $ESS for the treasury, once those tokens are officially minted. Stay tuned for more details!

Title: Earth 2 Unveils Mentar Staking, Earth 2 Hordes, and Withdrawal Update
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/08/04/mentar-staking-live/

====================================================================================================
August 04, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is excited to announce several significant developments and features in this latest update. This article will delve into the new Mentar Staking system, provide background information on our first upcoming E2V1 mini-game, Earth 2 Hordes, and explain its connection to the Mentar Staking system. Additionally, we will discuss important updates on the withdrawal process, including details on the Trial Withdrawal system set to launch next week.



Our long-term vision to build a geolocational metaverse encompassing resources, trading, building, socialising, commerce, experiences, conflict, gaming, and more remains unwavering. Our approach to building this metaverse is reflected in the way we have consistently released features and products while simultaneously advancing core technology for the 3D interactive world.



We are committed to achieving our goals through a series of progressive steps, each made publicly available to our Players in stages. These steps are designed to be beneficial and engaging for our Players and supporters. Instead of developing behind closed doors, we choose to involve our community, offering potential rewards as we advance this long-term project.







Mentar Staking



The Mentar Staking system is an exciting new feature that not only has the potential to boost the productivity of your property but will also play a pivotal role in our first mini-game, Earth 2 Hordes. The option to stake can be found on your profile page via the MENTAR STAKING button.&nbsp;



Players will have the option to supercharge their Mentar by staking Essence, effectively setting it up as a beacon that can attract creatures and beasts to your property. The types and numbers of creatures attracted will vary depending on the size of your property and the amount of Essence you stake.



How It Works



Attracted by the centralised power source of Essence inside the Mentar, creatures and beasts are drawn into a mission of self-sacrifice to pay homage to the property owner. Once they reach the Mentar, they will begin a process of dissolution, essentially de-synthesising their life force back into E-ther, which is then absorbed by the Mentar and bound to the staked Essence for the property owner to claim.



Factors Influencing Essence Strength



The strength of the Essence depends on several factors, including the size of the property, the Tier group, and the duration of time the owner has committed their Essence to the Mentar. Players may stake up to 2 Essence per tile and can choose durations of 10, 30, 60, and 90 days.



Potential Rewards



Depending on the options selected, there is the potential to attract anywhere from 0.4% to 158% extra E-ther compared to the base E-ther spawn rate that those tiles would usually receive. Generally, smaller properties attract less, and larger properties attract more due to the amount of Essence the Mentar can hold.



It is important to note that higher Tier properties have a higher base E-ther spawn rate. Although the percentage increase in attracted E-ther may sometimes be lower for higher Tier properties, the actual number of extra E-ther attracted is greater. Tier 3 properties do not have a Mentar and therefore cannot stake Essence via this system.



When you stake Essence, it will lock the tiles it is staked to meaning the property is also locked. Properties that are actively for sale on the Market Place will be automatically excluded when staking Essence to avoid a Player locking a property they already have for sale. Tiles locked for staking also cannot be upgraded through the duration of the staking period.



Claiming E-ther



The E-ther attracted by staked Essence in the Mentar will remain attached to the staked Essence until the Player collects it. It is usually detected and becomes claimable around midnight UTC after the first full day of being staked. Importantly, attracted E-ther cannot be raided by other Players and does not evaporate. It can be collected in the same pop up modal you use to claim your standard E-ther and Resources.



Future Adjustments and Use Cases



The Mentar Staking system may be adjusted over time, and we may introduce different utility cases. It is important to remember that Earth 2 is an emerging platform, a work in progress that is constantly in development. New features like the Mentar Staking system indicate that there will be new use cases and utility for Essence over time.



Therefore, the Essence a Player thinks they have just sitting around doing nothing right now will possibly have a purpose and use for them at some point in the future.



Transferring Essence from Web3 to an Earth 2 Account



Players can deposit Essence from their Web3 wallet into their Earth 2 account by following these steps:




Connect Wallet:

&#8211; Log in to your Earth 2 account.



&#8211; Go to the Settings page.



&#8211; Connect your Metamask wallet from which you are sending the Essence to your Earth 2 account.





Transfer Essence:

&#8211; Transfer the desired amount of Essence to the Main Earth 2 wallet.





Automated Credit:

&#8211; Once the transfer is complete, the system will automatically credit your Earth 2 account with the transferred Essence.



&#8211; It is strongly advised not to disconnect your wallet until you confirm that your account has been credited with the transferred Essence.






For additional information, log in to your Earth 2 account, navigate to the Settings page, connect your wallet, and click on the DEPOSIT option.







Earth 2 Hordes Mini-game



Earth 2 is thrilled to lock in its first planned mini-game experience within E2V1, Earth 2 Hordes. This mini-game is directly linked to the Mentar Staking system. Properties with staked Essence in their Mentars will attract various Hordes of beasts and creatures from within E2V1. These creatures are on a self-sacrificial mission to reach the Mentar and de-synthesise back into E-ther, which is then bound to the staked Essence inside the Mentar until claimed by the property owner.



Attracting Larger Hordes



The more Essence staked in the Mentar, the higher the chance of attracting larger and more powerful Hordes including larger creatures and beasts. Players can stake up to 2 Essence per tile, meaning larger properties with more staked Essence will have a greater potential to attract significant Hordes given they have a larger coverage area.&nbsp;



Co-Op PvE Game Mechanics



Earth 2 Hordes will be a Co-Op PvE game (Cooperative Player versus Environment). The game loop begins with Players entering a lobby system to find an available game. Once a game is found, Players are spawned onto the property just before an incoming Horde is activated. The goal of the units in the Horde is to take out anything standing in their way before they get to the Mentar and begin de-synthesising into the E-ther which is then attracted to the charged Essence in the Mentar.&nbsp;



Player Objectives



The goal for the Players is to set up a forcefield-like shield around the Mentar and intercept the Horde units with the aim of de-synthesising them before they reach the Mentar, while ensuring the Players remain alive.



Acquiring Weapons and Abilities



Players start each mini-game unarmed, relying on their bare hands and feet. Weapons and abilities can be acquired through drops from defeated Horde units, completing tasks, or finding loot and objects. These weapons and abilities will help Players compete against subsequent waves of Horde units.



Creature Variety&nbsp;



Depending on the property&#8217;s size and its Tier, as well as the amount and duration of staked Essence, the Mentar can attract a range of creatures. These can vary from small wildlife that Players may easily capture to more formidable beings such as Skeleton Warriors, Zombies, Rock Golems, Mech Units, Dragons, and even Red Coat Soldiers wielding mini-guns, which may pose a more significant challenge.&nbsp;



Property Size and Player Participation



The size of the property and its Tier, along with the amount and duration of staked Essence, also influences the types of creatures attracted. The property size also determines the number of Players that can participate in a single Earth 2 Hordes mini-game, with smaller properties hosting fewer Players.



Ongoing Development



The Earth 2 team is still finalising various design elements for the mini-game, including how landowners could benefit. Potential features we are confident that will be involved are the Broadcaster and the ability for landowners to control aspects of the rewards Players receive by playing on their property. While some details may change as development progresses, above all, the most important goal is to ensure the game loop is fun and entertaining.Quote from the Founder of Earth 2, Shane Isaac



&#8220;Earth 2 is a Metaverse platform, and true to the Metaverse concept, it does not adhere to any specific genre. This is something I love about Earth 2, as it gives us a lot of fun and freedom when designing games and experiences,&#8221; said Shane Isaac, CEO and Founder of Earth 2.



&#8220;After play-testing the E-ther Particle mini-game, it became clear that while it served a purpose in testing multiplayer networking and elicited a few laughs, it had limited engagement and lacked the potential for a long-term shelf life. It&#8217;s important to understand and accept where we are in our development; it is too early for competitive PvP in Earth 2, especially when rewards have monetary value, we need to get other aspects right first,” Shane went on to say.



&#8220;Although designing and developing a multiplayer co-op PvE game like Earth 2 Hordes is significantly more complex, I believe it is a better starting point. We need to focus on game design with a higher potential for ongoing fun and engagement, which is what people want to play. Game mechanics developed in Earth 2 Hordes will also serve as a precursor to us implementing random discoverable NPC units while exploring the open world.&#8221;



&#8220;Earth 2 Hordes will not only allow us to progressively test our multiplayer networking solution at a realistic scale but also provide opportunities to test avatar movement, animations, syncing, combat, NPC movement, and AI. Pre-baking a 510,072,000 km² map that also needs to be geologically accurate presents major challenges so you need dynamic nav-mesh systems functioning not only for avatars but also for NPCs within this massive open world. Developing and testing these systems in a mini-game like Earth 2 Hordes is extremely valuable for the long-term success of the project and will allow us to gradually implement game mechanics we plan to open up to landowners for the purpose of creating their own games or experiences on their properties.&#8221;



&#8220;Presently our focus is on Earth 2 Hordes, but I am excited about the future of Earth 2 and the possibilities it holds. We could go from Earth 2 Hordes to golf, racing, capture the flag, Easter Egg hunts, skiing, modern warfare, base jumping, building, and trading—all within the open world of E2V1, and that is without even touching on the Earth 2 Portal concept.&#8221;







Trial Withdrawal System



Earth 2 has invested over $600,000 USD in processing fiat withdrawals, covering costs such as KYC, accountants, processing fees, and other requirements essential for facilitating a global payment system. This significant expenditure underscores the importance Earth 2 places on its withdrawal system and the service it provides to Players. When interruptions arise, finding solutions becomes a top priority.



Periodic updates have been provided on withdrawal delays. Unofficially, it has been indicated that access to a crucial third-party provider, integral to our withdrawal system, was jeopardised due to the launch of Essence as a token and recent regulatory implications. We received no warning from the provider prior to this happening.&nbsp;



Navigating Complications and Adapting



The official launch of the Essence token was always going to risk new complications, given the changing compliance requirements across different jurisdictions and the challenges banks and service providers face in adapting. Navigating both Web3 and fiat environments inherently carries risks, but our community&#8217;s desire for a tradable token necessitated this step. When issues arise, we must be ready to adapt and find viable solutions.



While interruptions are often unavoidable and nobody likes them, the most important part is for us as a business to be as resourceful as possible and find a solution to those interruptions.&nbsp;



Contingency Plans and Reactions



To that extent, part of our messaging has been that no matter what, we would look at and work on all contingency plans, even if temporary, within the framework we have available to us and focus on which is the fastest, most plausible option to get withdrawals back on track.



Full Circle Web3 System&nbsp;&nbsp;



Following the token release and changing global regulations, it became evident that relying solely on the fiat system is impractical if we wish to reduce potential interruptions and operate effectively in Web3. Therefore, it would be imperceptive not to implement a full circle Web3 system, even for a rainy day, as not only would such a system give us better control without the need to rely on external third party service providers, but from what we have experienced to date, it would also significantly reduce the withdrawal costs for our Players.&nbsp;



Trial System for Withdrawals



Considering these factors, we have decided to trial an internal system, which is optional, allowing Players to withdraw their backlogged E$ withdrawals into Essence, based on the external trading price of Essence. While we continue to work on other fiat solutions, these will take time, especially with the live token that third-party providers must now consider. This trial system is the fastest, most plausible option we can control directly without relying on third-party contracts and approvals.



To be clear, Earth 2 remains committed to supporting a fiat withdrawal system, but this may require time. Therefore, we aim to provide our customers with an alternative option in the interim.&nbsp;



It is also important to note that a number of Players have actively requested this option from us.Key Points of the New System:




Players with pending withdrawals will be contacted by our support team or accounting team notifying them of this option. On occasion they may receive a notification on the platform via the notification system. However, our team will endeavour to send an email as well.



This option will be carried out in order of oldest requests to newest.



Once contacted, the Player will see an option appear on their withdrawal page providing them with the opportunity to receive their existing E$ withdrawal as&nbsp; Essence.



It is completely optional, and the Player can decide whether or not they want to accept this alternative over a period of about 5 days.



If after 5 days the Player has not accepted the option, then the button will no longer be available on their withdrawal page and they will need to wait until either the option becomes available again when the account team cycle through a second time,or if we finalise a solution for the fiat system.



During the 5 days, the Player is in control of when they execute the transaction.&nbsp;



Once a Player executes the transaction, they will have ownership of the Essence on the platform and can utilise it for anything such as Mentar Staking, building Cydroids, crafting, Essence withdrawals,and so forth.



As the external value of Essence can fluctuate up or down, we suggest that if the Player plans to immediately withdraw their Essence transaction, that they do it on a weekday at least a few hours before 2 pm GMT+10&nbsp;



There will be no charge to the Player for using this option to transact to Essence during the trial period.




Monitoring and Adjustments



This trial will be closely monitored, starting with a daily aggregated platform cap of E$5,000 and adjustments made as necessary. Elements such as, but not limited to, the five-day acceptance period may be modified based on observed results.



Future of Mentar Staking and the Trial System



The Mentar Staking system has been specifically developed, implemented and released ahead of schedule in order to reward Players holding Essence or acquiring more Essence. If this Trial Withdrawal System ceases to operate, the Mentar Staking system will also cease operating until such time that the Earth 2 Hordes Mini-game comes online.&nbsp;



We would like to point out and reassure our community that the Trial Withdrawal System will be 100% funded by Essence from the Earth 2 Treasury.&nbsp;







Feedback and Communication



If you have any feedback about this update, please do not hesitate to reach out to us directly via trialsystem@earth2.io. Please keep feedback or concerns focused only on this Withdrawal Trial System. We will keep this email open to receive any feedback for 3 weeks.

Title: Earth 2, 2024  | GDC Trailer
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/08/12/earth-2-gdc-trailer/

====================================================================================================
August 12, 2024 – Sydney, Australia – Earth 2 invites you to take a closer look at E2V1 with the official footage release from our GDC San Francisco 2024 showcase reel. E2V1 is a work in progress 1:1 scale, playable 3D digital version of our planet Earth being actively developed. This real-time, in-game footage offers an updated view of some of the vast and immersive qualities of E2V1 as we advance the development and refinement of its geologically accurate, massive open 510,072,000 km² map.







With a pre-alpha release planned for later this year, part of this footage highlights our progress on dynamic seasons, immersive day-night cycles, and an evolving biome system, all of which contribute to the realism of this expansive virtual environment. The video also showcases breathtaking draw distances, seamless transitions from surface to space, and global navigation.







E2V1 will feature pristine, untouched environments, programmatically cleared of man-made artefacts such as buildings, roads, and infrastructure. At the core of Earth 2 is Essence ($ESS), a tradeable resource that landowners have been actively mining from their land. Essence is set to become a key element in driving the economy and progression within the world. Among its many already existing and planned utilities, Essence will be essential for processing Resources into Raw Materials, allowing players to maximise the utility of their land and play an active role in not only shaping the future, but becoming part of it.







In other exciting news, we’re actively designing and integrating our first mini-game into E2V1, Earth 2 Hordes, which will also require Essence to activate and provide an additional layer of utility and engagement to Player owned properties. Mini-games like Earth 2 Hordes will help our team to test various game mechanics and our multiplayer system as we move forward onto developing other parts of the platform, so stay tuned for more updates!







We hope you enjoy this video, which provides a closer look at the ongoing development of E2V1. Although we are still in the early stages, we are excited to share this update as we continue to build and refine our geolocational metaverse, Earth 2.

Title: Wildlife in Earth 2 &#8211; Vol. 1
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/08/28/wildlife-vol-1/

====================================================================================================
August 28, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is excited to introduce the first look at wildlife to E2V1, inching the virtual world one step closer to our long term goal of a fully immersive experience. Our new team members have been hard at work behind the scenes, not just on wildlife but across several key areas of E2V1, ensuring that Earth 2 continues to develop and evolve.



As many know, E2V1 is a seamless 510,072,000 km² map, a 3D 1:1 scale geologically accurate representation of Earth. Creating a world of this magnitude presents unique challenges—you can&#8217;t simply pre-bake a world of this size. Our new team has been developing a dynamic navmesh system specifically for NPCs and other objects. This system is essential for bringing Earth 2 to life, allowing NPCs such as animals and other entities to use AI to navigate and interact with the environment around them inside this 510 million km2 map.



Recently we noticed a number of comments pointing out the lack of wildlife within E2V1. Coincidentally, our new team had already been focusing on a variety of initial animals to not only start the journey of wildlife inside Earth 2 but to help test various features being developed in parallel. These animals were sculpted, baked, and textured by our talented team before being brought to life to help test our new open world dynamic navmesh system being developed by the new team which is still a work in progress.&nbsp;



In terms of the appearance of these animals, Earth 2 has aimed for a slightly stylised look that remains semi-realistic while balancing an optimised poly count. This balance allows us to maintain a visually appealing and immersive environment while ensuring performance efficiency.



But this is just the beginning. We are committed to expanding the variety of animals in Earth 2, and future updates will introduce even more species. Additionally, we’re exploring the possibility of allowing Players to control animals, effectively stepping into the role of these creatures and participating in the food chain or other experiences. We’re excited that this feature could open up entirely new gameplay dynamics, where Players could experience life as an animal within Earth 2 and for animals to be used as part of mini-games and Player owned property experiences.



Our new team isn’t just focused on wildlife and the navmesh system— they’re also actively developing Earth 2 Hordes, our first upcoming mini-game, enhancing multiplayer functionality, working on our initial avatar customisation tool, preparing for the E2V1 pre-alpha, and more. The introduction of wildlife is just one part of a broader long term commitment&nbsp; to create a rich, dynamic world within Earth 2.



There is a LOT going on!



Looking ahead, we’re excited to share more in Wildlife in Earth 2 &#8211; Vol 2, where we’ll demonstrate the early AI we’re adding to wildlife. This will include behaviours like recognising their place in the food chain, deciding whether to fight or flee, foraging, and engaging in combat with both other animals and avatars.



Stay tuned as we continue to bring the world of Earth 2 to life one step at a time!

Title: Earth 2 Hordes: Early Combat Mechanics &#8211; Volume 1
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/09/18/combat-mechanics-volume-1/

====================================================================================================
September 18, 2024 – Sydney, Australia – Earth 2 is excited to share a very early look into its first combat mechanics with a video release and this article. While Earth 2 is envisioned as a multifaceted digital Metaverse with ambitions to encompass socialising, resource mining, building, trading, exploring, shopping and more, we believe a core element of our new incoming 3D experience should start with engaging gameplay that focuses on Players having fun first, but also importantly expands on the utility to Properties (Land), Essence, E-ther, Jewels, Cosmetics, and Resources.



As many in our community know, over the past three years, our team has been heavily focused on developing and implementing a massive open world solution that has the ability to deliver the geological accuracy required for the foundations of Earth 2’s 1:1 scale digital 3D Earth, E2V1. Geological accuracy was a non-negotiable, essential milestone we needed to fully develop first, especially due to the fact that Players have acquired land in correlating real-world locations via our 2D website map.&nbsp;



This means we did not have the luxury to simply procedurally generate a random world which is why our initial 3D world development required extensive time and effort to ensure areas of our 510,072,000 km2 map geologically matched reality. Although time consuming and still very much a work in progress that will be iterated on and improved over time, we are now excitingly at a stage where the foundations now laid are ready to test the first steps toward engagement and gameplay inside our massive open 3D world.



Earth 2 Hordes: An Overview







Earth 2 Hordes is the first 3D mini-game experience scheduled for E2V1. Directly connected to the newly introduced Mentar Staking system, it is set to open a whole new level of utility to Land, Essence, Resources and more. In this co-op PvE experience, Players will be able to intercept hordes of creatures drawn to the staked Essence inside the Mentar on a property.&nbsp;



To activate an Earth 2 Hordes game, you will need to own land and have Essence actively staked in the Mentar on that land. This will activate the mini-game and attract hordes of creatures to the property at a maximum frequency of once a day, depending on the size of the property and how much Essence is staked.&nbsp;



Property owners will have the ability to invite friends and battle the hordes on their properties, or add their qualified properties to the global Earth 2 game network lobby system which will allow Players to queue for random pending upcoming games.



More details are scheduled about how this system will function, but it is worth noting that Earth 2 Hordes will link into future features, such as the &#8220;Broadcaster,&#8221; which will require Resource Occurrence Units to create, and then Essence to load into the Broadcaster to maximise the potential of advertisements.



In addition to the Broadcasting system, it is also worth noting that over time landowners will be able to set participation requirements, set prizes, set drop split percentages, create billboards and more.

First Look at Combat Mechanics



The video provides a very early, unpolished preview of combat mechanics designed for Earth 2 Hordes with focus on the Katana, a weapon that Players will have the ability to arm their avatars with, unlocking a variety of combat manoeuvres and tactics.



Weapon Mechanics: The Katana



The Katana is just one of many weapons that will be available in Earth 2 Hordes, each with its own unique combat style. When players equip a weapon inside the mini-game, their avatar will adopt the specific combat animations that have been designed to complement the weapon&#8217;s playstyle. 



Importantly, no specific cosmetic skin is required to wield the Katana; Players will have the ability to arm themselves with this weapon regardless of their character’s skin or appearance.&nbsp;



For example, Anubis could pick up a Katana and start going ham.



Each weapon in Earth 2 Hordes will generally offer three special attacks and one ultra attack, most of which can be upgraded throughout the timeline of the mini-game. 



In this footage, we showcase the recently released Murushierago skin and the Night’s Edge Katana, both custom-created by our 3D modelling team.



Katana Special Attacks








Dash and Slash: This special attack allows players to dash through enemies, delivering a swift slash. This move consumes stamina and can be upgraded to increase damage and critical strike chance.



Combo Strikes with Jump Attack: A sequence of combo strikes with the Katana that ends with a powerful jump attack, creating a shockwave dealing damage to enemy units within the shockwave radius. This move consumes stamina, and upgrades enhance damage, critical strike chances, and knock-back impact.



Sky Fall Strike: The Player leaps into the air and delivers a devastating concentrated strike with the Katana upon landing while also unleashing a powerful shockwave that damages nearby enemies. Upgrades increase both the damage and the knock-back radius of this attack.




While the ultra attack is not featured in this footage, it will be revealed in future releases or at the game&#8217;s launch.



Custom Animations and Visual Effects



Our animation team created the custom animations used for each special attack listed above, ensuring fluid and aesthetic combat action. The visual effects (VFX) for these special attacks are still under development, and we have plans to showcase more refined VFX in future updates. Additionally, while custom animations for basic movement with the Katana, such as normal and fast running, have been created by our team, some of the other animations are placeholders for basic attacks and we intend to customise the look and style of these basic attack moves with our own animations in the future.



Standard Katana Attacks



Standard attacks with the Katana have been programmed to vary in damage depending on the strike type and target, with certain strikes having the potential to trigger critical hits. This adds a layer of unpredictability and tactical depth to combat encounters and offers the Player rewarding results for upgrading different aspects of their Katana wielding ability.







Introducing the Skeleton Warrior



Players will face a variety of enemies in Earth 2 Hordes which will intentionally stem from different genres and art styles staying true to the concept of the Metaverse. For now, we have used the Skeleton Warrior as the primary enemy unit for play testing. Armed with an axe, it is likely this enemy will be one of the first Horde units that Players encounter in the mini-game.&nbsp;



To provide our community with an idea on the type of work that goes into one basic enemy, here is some of the processes and work we’ve completed on the Skeleton Warrior so far :&nbsp;




Concept Art Creation:The concept art team designed the initial vision and visuals for the Skeleton Warrior, including detailed illustrations of its armour and weapon.



3D Modelling:The 3D modelling team then transformed the concept art into a fully-realised 3D model, also creating the matching axe for the Skeleton Warrior.



Texturing:Textures were applied to the Skeleton Warrior and its weapon by our artists, adding intricate details to give the model a lifelike appearance.



Rigging and Weight Painting:The rigging team created a skeletal structure for the model, enabling dynamic movement. Weight painting was applied to ensure smooth and realistic animations.



Custom Animation Creation:Our animators created a series of custom animations for the Skeleton Warrior, including:

Run



Walk forward



Walk left



Walk right



Walk backward



Turn left 90 degrees



Turn right 90 degrees



Idle



Receive damage



Death animation



Block



Attack 1



Attack 2



Running lunge attack





In-Game Integration:Once the animations were complete, the game development team integrated the Skeleton Warrior model, weapon, and animations into the game engine, testing its movement and combat mechanics.



Combat AI Implementation:The game dev team then implemented and refined combat AI for the Skeleton Warrior, allowing it to make tactical decisions such as attacking, dodging, blocking, and chasing Players during battle.



Navmesh Integration:The Skeleton Warrior was then integrated and tested in the E2V1 open-world environment navigation mesh (navmesh) system, enabling it to dynamically navigate and interact with Players across the terrain inside E2V1.



Stat Assignments:We also designed an early stats system which records key stats for the Skeleton Warrior to ensure balanced and challenging gameplay. These include:





Health Points (HP): Determines how much damage the Skeleton Warrior can take before being defeated.



Damage Output: Specifies how much damage the Skeleton Warrior inflicts with each of its attacks.



Attack Variations: Each attack, such as basic strikes or lunging attacks, has specific damage values. Different attack types are also assigned different ranges.



Critical Hit Chance: Some attacks may have a chance to deal extra damage through critical strikes.



Movement Speed: Determines how the default movement speed of the Skeleton Warrior.



Cooldown : Determines the interval between which various attacks and abilities can be utilised by the Skeleton Warrior.



Armour and Resistance: Defines the Skeleton Warrior’s ability to block or reduce incoming damage from the Player&#8217;s attacks.



Drop Item Chance:&nbsp; Defines what type of items the Skeleton Warrior could drop and the chance rate of those drops.








https://youtu.be/Qaxjne2jW9I?si=5YnuABXkj9uyi9MZ



In the opening 1:1 combat scenario in the video you will note where the Skeleton Warrior blocks and dodges the Katana attacks from the avatar. The footage goes on to showcase other combat AI with the Skeleton Warrior using group tactics, including lunging attacks (dealing 60 HP damage), dodging, and engaging the Player in various terrain settings.



Message from Earth 2 Founder, Shane Isaac



&#8220;Building a geologically accurate 510,072,000 km² open 3D Earth is no small feat, but we have laid the foundations and are looking ahead. The combat mechanics we are currently designing, creating, and implementing not only matter for Earth 2 Hordes but will also be used throughout different areas of E2V1 long term. This includes things like the multiplayer system, character controllers, syncing, navigation mesh, animations, hotkeys, enemy units, enemy AI, health, mana, stamina, hunger, and many other systems needed to release a mini-game like Earth 2 Hordes. In the short term the development of these systems not only contributes to providing our Players with engaging experiences inside E2V1, but they also represent important progress we can and will use for future parts of the metaverse platform we’re building,&#8221; said Shane Isaac, Founder of Earth 2.



&#8220;The first enemy units, such as the Skeleton Warrior, are primarily being developed for Earth 2 Hordes, however, don&#8217;t rule out the possibility of encountering such units randomly while exploring the open world of E2V1 at some point.&#8221;



&#8220;Although it&#8217;s been challenging to manage alongside my other obligations, I’ve really enjoyed working on the game design for Earth 2 Hordes so far. My goal is not only to expand on the utility of Land, Essence, and Resources, but to ensure Earth 2 Hordes is a mini-game that’s fun to play and maybe offer a few laughs along the way—challenging and engaging but not too serious. Though it’s not part of the current footage, there is a specific feature I wanted which has already brought out a few chuckles during playtests, so I look forward to demoing that in future footage releases.&#8221;



Closing Thoughts



The Katana and Skeleton Warrior combat mechanics shown in this video represent a very early phase of combat for Earth 2 Hordes. It’s still very early in development, and while there’s a lot more to refine, we wanted to take this opportunity to explain and show our community some of what we’ve been working on. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to sharing more updates as things take shape.



Stay tuned for future updates!

Earth 2 is building its own Metaverse platform, therefore, instead of following the approach of many games that rely on launchers like Steam or Epic Games, Earth 2 has taken the early initiative to develop its own launcher. This choice will allow for greater flexibility and control, making it easier to ensure that Players have a smooth and cohesive experience across all aspects of Earth 2.&nbsp;







Key Features of the Earth 2 Launcher







We have put together a few key points for those in the Earth 2 Community who do not understand what this launcher will do or what it will be used for:








Automatic Updates and Patching: The launcher will be able to detect software updates and automatically patch them into existing installations. Players will always have access to the latest version, improvements, and new content without needing to worry about manual updates.



Access to New Content and Experiences: As the Earth 2 Metaverse evolves, the launcher will not only support E2V1 but will also provide access to various facets of Earth 2 including new games, experiences, and content developed not only under the Earth 2 umbrella but also other publishers. This will ensure that players can easily discover and access new additions as they are released.



Comprehensive Management and Versioning: The Earth 2 Launcher will serve as a central command centre where players can manage downloads, track game versions, and handle other aspects of their experience in one place. We also intend to provide access to various parts of the Player’s Earth 2 accounts. This approach is designed to provide seamless access to various parts of the Earth 2 ecosystem as it continues to expand and develop.








Earth 2 Launcher Sneak Peek Video&nbsp;

















We’ve prepared a few explanations just in case you are curious about what some of the systems in the Earth 2 Launcher sneak peek video are:&nbsp;








E2V1: This represents the main, geologically accurate, 1:1 scale 3D Earth. It will initially be used to access the E2V1 Pre-Alpha build. Over time it will be used to navigate the world, explore with your avatar, survive, view properties, interact with systems inside E2V1, and more.



E2 Hordes: Earth 2 Hordes will become the first 3D mini-game inside Earth 2. It will be a smash-&#8217;em-up, fun-to-play, short to mid length game loop focused on Player owned properties that have Essence actively staked in the Mentar which will attract the Horde units. In addition to the game mechanics, Players will be able to collect E-ther and some loot drops such as cosmetics and other items.The initial purpose of E2 Hordes is to allow our team to test avatar movement, animations, battle mechanics, multiplayer and other systems pertinent to the future expansion of Earth 2.E2 Hordes will be accessible via the Earth 2 launcher and will provide access to a lobby system that queues Players waiting for games based on various criteria such as location and other target details.



EcoSim: The EcoSim always has been and always will be a fundamental part of Earth 2’s future. Players who participate in the EcoSim will be able to download and access it inside E2V1. The EcoSim will provide the ability to manage and build on properties using resources, Essence and more. Players will be able to build a variety of buildings, starting with industrial for processing raw materials into building blocks, manufacturing to produce various units, residential and leading onto actual retail and commercial infrastructure.At this point, depending on progress made in other facets of E2V1, we hope to launch the early stage of the EcoSim inside E2V1 some time in 2025.



Conquer: Conquer will become a global base strategy game where Players can create units to occupy and battle for territories and fly your flag. No more spoilers at this stage but it is our plan for Conquer to help test parts of the EcoSim and logistic systems.



Raiding: The Raiding mechanics that a devout group of Earth 2 Players have been so passionate about will be transformed into 3D gameplay inside E2V1. Players will be able to download and access the new Raiding game system via the Earth 2 Launcher.



Avatar: The Avatar system will allow Players to create, adjust and change their Avatar. We are still working on the avatar creation process, but initially this system will allow the Player to change their skins.




Setting the Foundations for the Earth 2 Metaverse







The creation of a custom launcher wasn&#8217;t on our road map, but it represents a positive step toward laying a strong foundation for the Earth 2 project. Many titles choose to release through third-party launchers, but Earth 2’s decision to develop its own launcher will not only streamline the player experience and ensure a well-integrated environment as the project expands, but facilitate and support&nbsp;new opportunities in the future.







By taking this approach, Earth 2 aims to establish better control over the user experience and enhance the ease of accessing new features, events, and content. The custom launcher will help provide a solid base for Earth 2&#8217;s future growth, allowing players to engage with the platform in a simple and organised manner.







Looking Ahead to E2V1 and Beyond







With the upcoming release of E2V1 Pre-Alpha, the Earth 2 Launcher will play a pivotal role in ensuring that players can easily access, update, and experience the various facets of the evolving metaverse.







This new launcher will be an important step toward a more integrated and accessible virtual experience, providing a glimpse into how Earth 2 is shaping its path forward. We’re eager to hear your thoughts—what do you think about the new Earth 2 Launcher?&nbsp;







We have a long journey ahead, but stay tuned as we continue to build and refine the Earth 2 Metaverse!











Join the journey, shape the future. Earth 2, the People’s Metaverse.

THE ARCHIOK SKIN AND IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT EARTH 2 SKINS (Read more)



There are many contributing factors that will make up the Metaverse and wearable cosmetics will certainly form one big part. We believe it is important for a contending platform in the Metaverse space to display the capability of creating its own appealing IP, effectively designing and developing a platform other IP brands want to be part of over time, not a platform that is solely reliant on its own existence because of other IP holders.



From concept art to being game ready, Archiok was an example of Earth 2’s ability to conceptualise a unique character that commands a certain presence and aura around it.. Archiok was used to demonstrate our capability of creating our own appealing IP, effectively designing and developing a platform other IP brands want to be part of over time, not a platform that is solely reliant on its own existence because of other IP holders.



KEY SUMMARY




Acquisition of Earth 2 skins is completely optional and can be done through the Earth 2 Skin store or (in the future) through a percentage of drop chance in the EcoSim;



Each Earth 2 skin may have a different supply limit and the EcoSim drop chance is affected by its supply limit;



Early supporters of the system have the opportunity to secure early skins at an attractive price and higher rarity for most of these skins;



Earth 2 skins incorporate a modular clothing system whereby most items of clothing are interchangeable on selected avatars with future opportunities to customise the fabric, prints, colours and more of the outfits;



100% of skins released in the Earth 2 skin store were uniquely designed by Earth 2 and produced via our own internal character pipeline; and



Earth 2 skins are developed game-ready, as showcased in the footage that accompanies each release

Major Feature Release &#8211; April 09, 2024







RESOURCE MINING GOES LIVE!



Though the article is yet to be released, this was one of the largest and highly anticipated feature releases to date with over 18 months of solid design and development: the EcoSim Resource System. Resource mining was released to the Earth 2 platform, bringing with it a suite of new and updated interfaces. The release of this system also manifested the years of preparation that dedicated Players have been doing as backdated Resources were accurately distributed to all eligible Players’ via their HoloBuildings. 



Now, Players who own land with specific resource types can continue to mine detected Resources and store them in their HoloBuildings until such a time as they can be transformed into Raw Material building blocks used to craft various EcoSim buildings, vehicles, and more. The current state of the EcoSim has been intentionally designed in such a way that the ongoing accumulation of resources between now and the next phase will by no means destroy or overflood the EcoSim.&nbsp;



KEY FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS




The Resource layer of the EcoSim is significant as it forms the basis for all buildings, vehicles and objects created by Players in the Earth 2 Metaverse;



The Resource system brings together the existing core EcoSim components we have already established;



Mined Resource Occurrence Units (O.Us) will be processed by the Weaver (upcoming feature) into Raw Materials. Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks;



The Discovery Tier of Resources is significant as they determine the scarcity of the Resource that Players are able to mine;



Involves a solution that has enabled us to achieve almost completely unique Resource output potential for the over 4.5 million player-owned properties;



Resource Occurrence Units are special data collected by the Mentar or Prospecting Cydroids through the E-ther that has evaporated from the land, these can only be stored in Holobuildings placed on the property;



FirstGen Prospecting Cydroids can be fused to obtain more Occurrence Unit read potential on a property, with the recipe to craft these Cydroids carefully revealed over the past several months with each Resource release;



Cydroid fusion itself involves its own mechanics of probability of crafting Prospecting Cydroids with more or less Resource Boost slots used to further increase O.U. yield power;



Introduction of the Geologist civilian, which can be supported on properties without any other occupations, and which does not require RE for sustenance;



HoloBuildings are not only an expression of creativity but are localised storage for Resource O.Us mined from the land;



New Claim interface introduced, enabling Players to claim E-ther and O.Us simultaneously, or delay Resource claiming until identified issues with storage can be resolved so as not to lose any O.Us;



New Claim Setting interface for each property, dedicate to the complete organisation of Resource mining on a property, allowing Player to dictate the priority of mining of each Resource available on a property, and manage the efficiency of their mining operations;



New possibilities for strategic gameplay: increasing O.U. yield for optimal productivity;



Delivering on the promise of backdated Resources for up to 1000m3 HoloBuildings on each property, at the maximum frequency for each Resource detected and primed using the correct Jewel on all eligible properties; and



Introduction of Prospecting Cydroids to the Earth 2 Bazaar, increasing trade opportunity for Players

Major Feature Release &#8211; June 23, 2024









THE EARTH 2 LAND UPGRADE SYSTEM (Read more)



The Land Upgrade system is a specialised system which importantly requires Essence, or a combination of Essence plus an energy type, to infuse your land with a sudden burst of power through the Mentar resulting in a permanent upgrade to that property. The careful design of this system creates a number of key variables which Players will need to take into consideration. It is the first of many examples of Essence utility, where the Essence utilised is not only spent, but also introduces a new burn mechanism.&nbsp;



KEY FEATURE SUMMARY

This update announcement detailed the new Mentar Staking system, provided background information on our first upcoming E2V1 mini-game, Earth 2 Hordes, and explained its connection to the Mentar Staking system. Additionally, we shared important updates on the withdrawal process, including details on the Trial Withdrawal system that was set to launch following the announcement.



KEY SUMMARY




Introduction to Mentar Staking system, a potential boost to productivity and an important role to play in the upcoming mini-game, Earth 2 Hordes;



Mentar Staking system interface located within the Player profile;



Essence staked within the Mentar may attract creatures and beasts onto the property;



Strength of staked Essence depends of factors including the size of the property, land Tier and duration of the stake;



Staking offers the potential to attract anywhere from 0.4% to 158% extra E-ther compared to the base E-ther spawn rate;



The Mentar Staking system may be adjusted over time;



Hordes Mini-Game involves hordes of creatures and beasts being attracted to the Essence stake to a property, the greater the staked Essence the greater the potential Horde size;



Hordes will be a Co-Op PvE mini-game loop beginning with a lobby system and Players are spawned onto a property just before the arrival of an incoming Horde;



The goal is for Players to set up a forcefield around the Mentar and intercept the Horde units with the aim of de-synthesising them to take their E-ther life-force while ensuring the Players stay alive;



Hordes will require the acquisition of various weapons and abilities, and involve creature variety depending on the property size and player participation;

Project Milestone &#8211; September 28, 2024



The First Edition Civilian caps were reached for the Cydroid Technician, E-ther Reckoner and Raid Commander occupations (see metrics)



In the condensed Earth 2 White Paper that was published, it was confirmed that a cap of 500,000 would be applied to each of the First Edition civilian occupations. The first of the Civilian occupations to reach their cap was the Cydroid Technician, essential for automatically charging depleted Cydroids whether raiding or prospecting. This saw a direct impact on the price of Cydroid Technician civilians as no more civilians of these capped occupations can be synthesised, yet the demand continues to grow.&nbsp;







Digital Asset Development and&nbsp;Releases &#8211; September, 2024



&nbsp;Earth 2 Custom Made Skins



Exclusively From Earth 2’s Internal Character Pipeline, Earth 2 skins are a testament to the capabilities of our own IP to compete and thrive within the massive 50 billion dollar cosmetic gaming skins industry. Earth 2 hired new team members to focus on creating unique, exclusive skins designed and created by Earth 2 which not only allow us to develop our own internal Character Development Pipeline but also use that pipeline to develop other digital objects such as the Skeleton Warrior, Zombie, Rock Golem, Animals and more.



A lot of work has gone into each of the skins listed below, starting from concept art which is reviewed and goes through numerous iterations before final approval. Once approved, it is then passed to our 3D modelling team for sculpting into high-poly then into low-poly with further reviews and strict adherence to our pipeline protocols throughout the process. When the low-poly model is finished, the 3D team finalises the model with UV mapping and texture baking, running through their own QA processes during this stage.



Once the entire 3D-sculpted model is approved, the models enter the skinning, rigging and weight painting process before being passed on to our animation team for further testing with various animations involving another set of QA such as minimising clipping and identifying any other potential flaws in the model.&nbsp;



The model then goes through the final process of approval with a game developer to ensure it passes all final tests and is absolutely game-ready for E2V1.&nbsp;



Excitingly, Earth 2 has also accepted and developed 3 community submitted concepts and turned them into bona fide in-game wearable skins that will live on inside of Earth 2! This initiative not only provides rewards to winning submissions, but uniquely allows for the creation of Earth 2 Community members to become a mainstream part of the Earth 2 Metaverse!

Over the past 12 months, we’ve achieved 41 notable releases, events, or milestones, not counting the hundreds of sub-tasks needed to accomplish each one. For a small team, this is a significant amount of work, especially considering the many developments not listed above which we are working on behind closed doors, alongside ongoing efforts in management, support, QA, accounting, legal, design, and the countless tasks required to keep Earth 2 chugging along.



We do plan to release a couple of progress videos related to Earth 2 Hordes and mini-game development with supporting articles this month, along with a little feature drop to mix up the celebration month, but please forgive us for otherwise not being too active this birthday month. We have experienced setbacks this year with regards to E2V1, but our new team is focused on releasing the base version into the hands of our Players, even if it’s buggy, aiming for January as an internal goal, but please note this timeline may shift if needed.



The release of E2V1, as a rudimentary base version, will show our community that we have built this incredible foundation for the Earth 2 Geolocational Metaverse and will importantly give us a starting point for the transition into our 3D world. We want the next 12 months to be about quickly releasing a base version of E2V1 which we can improve, build on and expand much like we have done to date with the website.



We want the bare bones of E2V1 live.&nbsp;



We want Players to start accessing their properties inside E2V1, on a global scale.&nbsp;



We want to enter the next phase of Earth 2, and we want to do this with our incredible community as we begin opening up Earth 2 Version 1, to the world.











Join the journey, shape the future. Earth 2, the People’s Metaverse. 



About Earth2



Earth 2® is a futuristic concept for a second earth; a metaverse, between virtual and physical reality in which real-world geolocations correspond to user generated digital virtual environments. These environments can be owned, bought, sold, and in the near future deeply customised.

Title: The Earth 2 EcoSim &#8211; Mining: The Beginning of a New Era!
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/11/15/earth2-ecosim-mining/

====================================================================================================
November 16, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; &nbsp;And so Earth 2 enters a new phase—an era that will gradually open doors to a world of new opportunities for those Players ready to shape a living, breathing, global ecosystem from the land they own. This release marks the dawn of the dynamic Earth 2 EcoSim, a time of new beginnings, where war chests for dynasties may begin to form, strengthen positions for future alliances, and the seeds of global trade, industry, and building start to take root.&nbsp;



As the foundations of the EcoSim unfold, we can envision the collection, processing and exchange of resources, and the rise of strategic building, with exploration transitioning into remote outposts, developing into townships, and some maybe strong enough to slowly evolve into bustling megacities dotted around the world. This is just the beginning — a time for gathering, planning, and pioneering a path forward as we welcome the first major steps of the massive, dynamic, Player-driven, global scale Earth 2 Resource System &#8211; the Earth 2 EcoSim.



Earth 2 is pleased to share insight and details into the largest feature release from Earth 2 to date: the EcoSim Resource System. The Resource layer of the EcoSim is a significant one as it forms the basis for almost all future buildings, vehicles and objects created by Players in the Earth 2 Metaverse. This article will detail everything you need to know to get started with Resource Occurrence Units for replicating Raw Materials which will be critical for any kind of progression in the Earth 2 EcoSim; something we anticipate will be a highly traded asset inside of Earth 2, in terms of volume, once transportation systems come online inside E2V1.



A POWERFUL SYSTEM



The Earth 2 Resource System was brought online earlier this year and is a notable achievement of software engineering, the culmination of months of design, development, testing, and implementation. Every day, within a four-hour cycle, this powerful system generates over 170,000,000 O.U.’s as it processes nearly 400,000,000 mutable data points. Each data point is processed based on adjustable information, such as the eligibility to spawn resources, but also based on variables like current slotted Jewels, Cydroids, Land Tier, and more.



This Earth 2 Resource System serves as a backbone for Earth 2’s 1:1 scale global EcoSim, and in addition to the system processes that determine over 170,000,000 O.U.&#8217;s daily, simultaneously enables Players to claim tens of millions of O.U.’s, recently averaging over 140,000,000 O.U.’s per day, while maintaining a complete transactional record of each claim event.&nbsp;



This means, in addition to other data workload, the Earth 2 Resource System alone generates over 11,000 Resource O.U.&#8217;s per second while simultaneously allowing Players to claim and store over 140,000,000 O.U.&#8217;s throughout a typical day cycle.



This system handles big data and has been designed and built to scale long term and is a critical piece of in-house technology, supporting both current and future requirements for sustainable growth.



Introduction



Economic Simulators are rarely simple and while this new Earth 2 system may feel quite complex at first, the mechanics of how each of its components interact purposefully together provides various opportunities for unique, enriching and rewarding Player strategies overall.&nbsp;



This monumental release crucially brings together the existing core EcoSim components we have established (Jewels, HoloBuildings, Resource detection, the Mentar and E-ther, Cydroids, and Civilians), alongside new expansions to existing systems (Prospecting Cydroids and Geologist Civilians) to deliver a robust foundational Resource System offering many opportunities for gameplay and strategic depth for Earth 2 Players who are interested in pursuing EcoSim ventures. The boosted utility to the above core EcoSim components, or digital byproducts, has been strategically planned to prepare for a significant utility boost to Essence once Raw Materials and other aspects of the EcoSim are released.



EARTH 2 PLAYER TYPES



In the past, we’ve emphasised that Earth 2 is being designed to bring different types of Players, and different types of people, together, inside an evolving Metaverse, each with their own preference of gameplay. With that vision in mind, we plan to design and build systems that will deliver a range of mini-games and experiences in E2V1, each tailored to these various Player types. 



We understand that some Players may find the EcoSim complex or challenging, and that’s because it’s crafted with a certain kind of Player type in mind—the strategist, the explorer, the builder, the trader, the one looking to master and potentially capitalise on the intricate mechanics of this global size EcoSim.&nbsp;



Therefore, we would like to gently remind our community that before diving into this article, remember: the Earth 2 EcoSim is designed for a specialised Player type and may not be everyone’s perfect fit!&nbsp;



If you don&#8217;t believe you fit into this Player group, then read on at your own risk!



EARTH 2 RESOURCES



Just like our planet Earth, Earth 2 has Resources that are distributed across its virtual land, mostly based on their real-world geolocation. There are 32 Resources that have been officially discovered inside Earth 2 so far and which form the underlying foundation for the core building aspect of the EcoSim. 24 of these resources are still currently available to claim via the E2PRV system, but only for a limited time.&nbsp;



If there is a Resource detected on a Player’s property they will have the ability to mine that Resource by gaining its Occurrence Units (O.U.&#8217;s) which will, in turn, be processed into Raw Materials by an upcoming EcoSim component called the Weaver. The Weaver will require Essence to be staked and in some cases burned, to process the O.U.’s into Raw Materials.



Through a variety of different types of factories, Raw Materials will then be used as the core ingredients for creating over 200 unique Building Blocks used for constructing a variety of Buildings, Factories, Power Cells, Engines , Energy Producing Technologies, Broadcast Devices, Machinery, Military-Grade Technologies, and more inside Earth 2’s open 3D world, E2V1.







These 32 Resources are categorised into Discovery Tiers which are characterised by their:&nbsp;




Application Capacity: higher Discovery Tier Resources will generally be applied in more advanced technologies (Building blocks &amp; Objects)



Global Rarity: higher Discovery Tier Resources are more scarcely available in the virtual soil of Earth 2 than lower Discovery Tier resources. This rarity is separate to Resource Frequency which is explained further down.&nbsp;



Yield Difficulty: higher Discovery Tier Resources will generally be more difficult to yield as their density in the soil is more scarce than lower Discovery Tier Resources.&nbsp;




Based on these Discovery Tiers, some Resources cannot be yielded by the Mentar alone and are not supported by properties lower than Tier 1 (see our previous announcement for Discovery Tier requirements for each Resource).&nbsp;



Earth 2 has allowed for most Discovery Tier Resources to remain openly claimable by Players via the E2PRV system. However, after a period of time, now soon coming to an end, these will close and may only open periodically, with the higher Discovery Tier Resources opening less frequently and for shorter periods of time, if ever. Earth 2 may also allocate new locations for various Resources in the future but these will predominantly be focused on new areas rewarding Players who explore and prospect inside E2V1 and these locations in some situations may be scarce, meaning that depending on long term EcoSim balancing, the higher Discovery Tier Resources secured on land through the E2PRV system today may end up becoming the major source of such Resource ownership and control long term!



These are important facts to know as a Landowner but all prospective EcoSim Players should carefully consider the following information in addition to the Discovery Tier restrictions and requirements.&nbsp;



Resource Frequency Categories



Resource Frequencies reveal the density of the Resource occurrence in the virtual soil of Earth 2 and has, up until now, been separated into 2 general categories: ‘HF’ and ‘UF’ (High Frequency &amp; Unknown Frequency). Gone are those days of wondering what ‘UF” Resources might mean, with the release of the EcoSim Resource system, the precise and detailed frequency category system for Resources has finally been unveiled. For all Resources detected in Earth 2 land, the following 5 frequency categories are applied:




Copious (previously under ‘HF’)



Rich (previously under ‘UF’)



Moderate (previously under ‘UF’)



Sparse (previously under ‘UF’)



Deficient (previously under ‘UF’)




This change to pre-existing Resource frequency information is not random and has been strategically implemented to align logically with real-world Resource accuracy and enhance the realism of Resource distribution in Earth 2.



Until recently, Resource frequencies were often referred to on the assumption that they were attributed on a ‘per property’ basis. However, we can now confirm that frequency categories, and subsequent Occurrence Units, are so refined and granular that they are in fact attributed on a ’per tile’ level to individual tiles on a property for the Resources present in the land, if detected on the property at all. This is how Earth 2 has been able to achieve an almost completely unique Resource output potential for the over 6.1 million player-owned properties. A Player who owns 2 neighbouring properties with exactly the same Resources distributed on them will sometimes experience slightly different yields based on this intricate design.&nbsp;



Frequency categories at the tile level are not visible for the Landowners though which is something to consider when analysing the output data from your properties. For now, Players need only concern themselves with their property’s overall frequency category. While a property may almost always contain tiles of a range of Resource frequencies, the design strictly dictates that at least 80% of a property’s Resource tiles match the main frequency category; you can think of this as the minimum frequency.&nbsp;



As an example, a 750 tile property attributed with a frequency category of ‘Copious’ for gold means that the lowest frequency for 80% of the tiles with detected gold from that property are ‘Copious’ frequency. This can be further broken down into the 600 tiles which actually have gold and at least 80 % of these tiles (480 out of 600) will be ‘Copious’. The other 20% (120) may have any other frequency category attribution. However, as ‘Copious ’is the main category, it is less likely to have ‘Deficient’ frequency category tiles as compared to say an overall ‘Sparse’ frequency property. Note that this minimum 80% applies only to the tiles that actually have the Resource detected. If only 200 of the 750 tiles have gold detected, then it would mean that 80% of the 200 tiles will be attributed a minimum frequency of ‘Copious’.



Resource Occurrence Units



Most Resources in Earth 2 are situated deep underground, much like Resources in the real world. As E-ther evaporates from the virtual land, it carries with it the binary data of Resources present in the land which is measured in Occurrence Units (O.U.&#8217;s).&nbsp;



Even the smallest capturable E-ther particle (0.01 E-ther) could potentially contain an abundant amount of O.U.&#8217;s. However, this binary data contained within the E-ther may only be read once by a prospector at the moment the E-ther is captured. As each particle of E-ther potentially contains O.U.&#8217;s for multiple Resources it means that Landowners must carefully decide which Resources to prospect out of&nbsp; each E-ther particle that is captured and read.&nbsp;



Importantly, in order for land to spawn the E-ther which contains Resource O.U.&#8217;s, a Mentar is required to draw out or attract the E-ther from the land. This is why Tier 3 properties are unable to yield O.U.&#8217;s as the SEED is not able to activate the land’s natural E-ther spawn but may only attract boosted E-ther which has gone unclaimed from Tier 1 and Tier 2 properties located in the same country.&nbsp;



O.U. values attributed to each tile (as described in Resource Frequency Categories above) contribute to a Property&#8217;s maximum Occurrence Unit value calculated for each Resource that has been detected on their property. Only Tier 1 properties can fully leverage this maximum value whereas Tier 2&nbsp; properties have reduced read capacity of these values and Tier 3 properties have no read capacity at all, emphasising the role that property upgrades play in EcoSim Resource strategic gameplay.&nbsp;



Reduced read capacity means that even though the Yield Power and Yield Effect is at 100% in your Resource claim settings, a Tier 2 property will still read and mine less than if it was a Tier 1 property which has maximum read capacity of the O.U.’s in the E-ther, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Accessing Resource Data From Your Properties



The ability to access the property Resource data is directly dictated by Tier hierarchy. The following table illustrates the Tier requirements that must be met in order to access the Resource data on player-owned land.&nbsp;



Land TierDetected ResourceFrequency CategoryOccurrence Unit ValueTier 1RevealedRevealedRevealed by GeologistTier 2RevealedD1-D6 Revealed&nbsp;D7-D9 Displayed as UnknownD1-D6 Revealed by GeologistD7-D9 HiddenTier 3RevealedDisplayed as UnknownHidden



To unlock exclusive access to a certain Tier of Land, a property must be upgraded, for example Tier 3 upgraded to Tier 2 or Tier 2 upgraded to Tier 1. Furthermore, yielding can only occur when the exact Resource frequency category is known, even if a Resource has been detected. If the frequency is ‘Unknown’, the Land Tier must be upgraded to unlock O.U. yield from that property.&nbsp; Conversely, revealing the exact Occurrence Unit value is not required for mining O.U.’s and so the Geologist Civilian (detailed later in this article) is not a core requirement for Resource production. However, having access to O.U. values may facilitate strategic planning and optimised gameplay.&nbsp;&nbsp;



These EcoSim restrictions based on Land Tier are well known and contribute to healthy gameplay mechanics. Benefits for Tier 1 Land are a reward to our original Earth 2 Players as well as an incentive for Players to dedicate themselves to progressing the strength of their portfolio in the Earth 2 EcoSim by upgrading their land or acquiring it from existing Players.&nbsp;



THE EARTH 2 RESOURCE SYSTEM



The Resource system involves the mining of Resource O.U.&#8217;s from Player-owned land, and later the production of Raw Materials from these O.U.&#8217;s utilising Essence, which are then crafted into Building Blocks. It is important to understand each of the following existing and expanded EcoSim components and the role they play in the Resource system, as they each influence Players’ abilities to yield O.U.&#8217;s from their lands.&nbsp;



THE MENTAR: PRIMING RESOURCE PRODUCTION WITH JEWELS



The Mentar was the first structure erected on properties in Earth 2 and is the source of many EcoSim activities. Almost everything in the Earth 2 EcoSim begins as a product or by-product of the land, and the Mentar is the only structure so far with the unique ability to capture what the land has to offer and harness them to the will of the landowner.&nbsp;



The Mentar’s critical ability to attract and capture E-ther and Jewels makes it essential for yielding Resource O.U.&#8217;s. The majority of Earth 2 Players, especially those just starting their EcoSim journey, will be reliant on the power of the Mentar to begin mining Resources from their lands.&nbsp;



Note: As Tier 3 land cannot yield any Resources due to the fact that their Mentar is in the SEED Stage and there is no natural E-ther that evaporates from the soil, upgrading T3 Land is the only way to yield O.U.&#8217;s from that property.&nbsp;











In addition to having a Mentar on the property, the Mentar’s Jewel slots must be primed for mining using the Prime Jewels associated with the Resources on the property (see the Resources chart shown above). Without these Jewels feeding critical information about the Resource the landowner desires to yield from their property, the Mentar is unable to read and extract the specific O.U.&#8217;s from the E-ther that it collects.&nbsp;



Prime Jewels were named for their ability to prime the production of the associated Resource on the land. The Quality and Tier of these Prime Jewels also determine their priming capacity and boost to the Mentar’s Yield Power. The Resource that is primed by a Jewel and how much boost is applied to the O.U. yield can be revealed by hovering over the Jewel to reveal its detailed effects.&nbsp;











THE PROSPECTING CYDROID: OPTIMISING O.U. YIELD



Gen 1 Cydroids were built by luring and capturing Metasprites using the Mentar’s ability to harness Essence. The Essence that was used to capture these Metasprites imparted upon these Cydroids an intrinsic connection to the land. It is also known that Jewels have a similar connection having spawned directly from the land. It was quickly discovered that these shared connections to the land could be exploited to unlock special abilities when specific Jewels were fused with compatible Cydroids.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Obtaining Prospecting Cydroids&nbsp;



A Cydroid’s primary ability is raiding E-ther from neighbouring lands. However, a Gen 1 Cydroid may also acquire the ability to Prospect Resource O.U.&#8217;s when fused with a compatible Jewel associated with the Resource they are both connected to. To obtain a Prospecting Cydroid, fusing must be done by going to ‘Administration’ in the Profile Menu and finding the Cydroid to fuse. The correct Cydroid associated with the Resource detected on the host property must be selected. For example, the Cephalo Cydroid tethered to a property with Iron detected (refer to the Resources chart for compatible Cydroids and Prime Jewels).&nbsp;











Selecting the ‘FUSE’ button will allow Players to choose a Jewel to fuse with the Cydroid. Once the fuse is successfully completed, a new Resource boost area will be unlocked, located at the bottom of the Cydroid Boost page. Only the Jewels that prime or boost the Resource the Prospecting Cydroid is specialised for will be displayed for slotting into these Special Fuse Boost slots.











Fusing a Jewel and Cydroid successfully will irreversibly consume the Jewel in the process of creating the Prospecting Cydroid. When an attempt to fuse the Cydroid with an incompatible Jewel is made, the Jewel will simply return to the Jewel Inventory. Experimenting with the fuse process is, therefore, safe to do.&nbsp;











The Quality and Tier of the Jewel used to fuse with a Cydroid will affect the chances for higher base Resource Yield Power and the number of Fuse Boost slots that are available in the Cydroid. Tier 3 Prime Jewels of the highest Quality provide the greatest chance to achieve the best Yield Power and Boost slots. Brilliant Jewels will not appear as being available to fuse with Cydroids to eliminate any possibility of these rare and coveted Jewels being accidentally consumed in the process.&nbsp;











As successfully fusing a Cydroid with a Jewel is irreversible, the decision on what Tier and Quality Jewel to use should be made wisely. The following table reveals the probability of unlocking more Resource Boost slots in a prospecting Cydroid depending on the Tier and Quality of the Jewel used.&nbsp;











The resulting Resource Boost slots in a Prospecting Cydroid can be slotted with Jewels to further boost the Cydroids&#8217; Yield Power. These jewels, as opposed to the Jewel initially used to fuse with the Cydroid, can be unslotted at any time. They will also be automatically unslotted and returned to the original owner if the Cydroid is sold in the Bazaar so that precious Jewels are not accidentally sold. Having more Resource Boost slots gives a single Prospecting Cydroid to have higher overall Resource Yield Power. Of course this is also affected by the Boost power of the slotted Jewels themselves.&nbsp;



When the Prospecting Cydroid is successfully fused the specialised Resource icon will be displayed next to the Cydroid’s image. The Prospecting Cydroid will now appear as an option to assign for prospecting on the property to which it is tethered.&nbsp;







THE GEOLOGIST: UNVEILING HIDDEN RESOURCE OCCURRENCES OF THE LAND



The Geologist’s main ability is to analyse the soil and uncover the exact value of the Occurrence Units contained within each land tile. Even for the specialised Geologist it is challenging to uncover the density and exact frequency category of Resources from the higher Discovery Tiers, due to their scarcity in the land. As the Geologist becomes more experienced, they will be able to more accurately analyse the density and reveal the Occurrence Unit values of higher Discovery Tier Resources.&nbsp;

For every O.U. yield from the property, the resident Geologist is able to analyse the data with great scientific skill to derive the density of the O.U.&#8217;s in the soil of the tiles where the prospector collected the E-ther. While the Civilians on the Raiding team share the XPs obtained through their Raiding exploits, the Geologist gains experience as O.U.&#8217;s are yielded and analysed. For the Geologist to hone their skills to reach higher XP levels, O.U.&#8217;s must be yielded from the host property for the Geologist to analyse, as 1 XP is gained for every 3 O.U.&#8217;s collected.&nbsp;











It is important to note that yielding O.U.&#8217;s without a Geologist is possible. However, employing a Geologist will enable deeper insights into the exact O.U. values in the land for better decision making on the yield strategy.&nbsp;



Synthesising the Geologist&nbsp;



The conflict-driven Civilians in the Cydroid flight bay seek to gain Red Energy for sustenance, but the Geologist is partial to the delicate art of science and has learned to forage for food from their natural environment when out on their daily excursions. Thus they do not partake in Red Energy for sustenance. Furthermore, synthesising this peaceful Geologist is much easier and only requires 10 E-ther to bring to life, plus no Red Energy to sustain.&nbsp;&nbsp;



With the introduction of the Geologist, the Civilians synthesis process has been improved to allow Players to synthesise any Civilian in any order. This will allow Players to synthesise a Geologist on a property that is to be dedicated to Resource production without having to synthesise an entire raiding team.&nbsp;&nbsp;











Without the Geologist the O.U. values will be hidden. Once the insights are unlocked for a particular Resource, the equivalent m3 value will also be displayed. However, the conversion to physical raw material m3 is conducted by the Weaver which will be available in a future release.&nbsp; It is important to distinguish that for Resource Insights, the m3 value indicates how much HoloBuilding storage space the O.U.&#8217;s will fill, with 10,000 O.U.&#8217;s fitting into 1m3 HoloBuilding storage. Whereas, in Resource Storage, the m3 value indicates how many Raw Materials can be crafted from the amount of O.U.&#8217;s currently stored, with 100 O.U.&#8217;s making up 1m3 of physical Raw Materials.



&nbsp;











HoloBuildings: Localised Inventory for O.U. Storage



When HoloBuildings were introduced to the Earth 2 platform, they were intended to function as additional storage space for Resources that existed at the beginning of the EcoSim. These user-generated HoloBuilding designs not only added uniqueness to properties with built forms but also served as the first medium for user creativity and expression that could be displayed on properties and viewed in 3D from the map.



These user-generated HoloBuildings are the first available storage for O.U.&#8217;s for the property they are built on. The m3 volume of all HoloBuildings placed on a property are aggregated to make up the total O.U. storage capacity for that property. 1m3 of HoloBuilding volume is able to store 10,000 O.U.&#8217;s. When O.U.&#8217;s are stored in aggregated HoloBuilding space, the system is designed to automatically store them in the HoloBuilding with available storage space.&nbsp;



Once a HoloBuilding is built on a property, the Landowner may begin to store any O.U.&#8217;s they have the ability to collect from that property. The following messages describe the HoloBuilding storage capacity status on a property that has O.U.&#8217;s available to store:




Will Be Saved



Will Fail To Save




When available O.U.&#8217;s are ready to be stored but the system has detected issues with the Storage capacity on one or more properties, the designed system presents an option in the claiming module called “Show Capacity Issues” which will reveal the following when selected:&nbsp;&nbsp;




Properties with full storage space;



Properties that will fail to store the predicted O.U.&#8217;s in the next E-ther Claim; and



Properties that have assigned Prospectors to obtain O.U.&#8217;s but have no HoloBuilding to store the O.U.&#8217;s available to collect.&nbsp;












Currently it is not possible to discard specific Resource O.U.&#8217;s that are already stored in a HoloBuilding to make space for new O.U.&#8217;s without first altering the HoloBuilding storage capacity itself. This can be done by editing the HoloBuilding and adding more volume to the HoloBuilding itself. A 10m3 HoloBuilding can be built for the cost of E$0.01 which is capable of holding up to 100,000 O.U.&#8217;s. The O.U.’s stored in HoloBuildings will naturally decrease once options like processing them into Raw Materials becomes available via the Weaver and other Utility Earth 2 has planned for O.U.’s.



Note: HBs smaller than 10m3 may be constructed but the lowest construction cost E$0.01.&nbsp;











In the event where a built HoloBuilding is reduced in size (m3) there is a risk that the new storage capacity will drop below what is required to continue storing the O.U.&#8217;s that are contained within the existing HoloBuilding. The Player must then decide how many O.U.&#8217;s of each Resource stored should be discarded in order to successfully reduce the HoloBuilding size. The volume amount that the HoloBuilding was reduced by will be saved as “Unallocated Volume” in the Player’s account and can be used to increase (up to the equivalent volume) any other HoloBuilding they construct.











In the event where a built HoloBuilding is deconstructed and removed from the property completely, all O.U.&#8217;s stored in the HoloBuilding will be irreversibly and irretrievably lost. The HoloBuildings which reside in the Ethereal plane is how O.U. transfers are received from the Mentar and without these HoloBuilding all O.U.&#8217;s read by the Prospectors are lost in the Ethereal plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;











Getting Started: Mining Resource Occurrence Units



To begin Resource production on a property, the following minimum requirements must be met to successfully yield Resource O.U.&#8217;s:




The Resource is detected on the property and the frequency category is revealed (Copious, Rich, Moderate, Sparse, Deficient);



A Mentar is constructed on the property and the Prime Jewel associated with each of the detected Resources desired for production is slotted (Prospecting Cydroids can also be used and the process is detailed further down); and



A HoloBuilding with available storage capacity is built on the property (i.e. not already full with backdated Resources)




Once these minimum requirements are met, the O.U. yield process will automatically begin. All that is left to do is to regularly claim the E-ther and Resource to ensure that any mined O.U.&#8217;s are safely collected and stored in the aggregated HoloBuilding storage on the property.











When claiming E-ther and Resources, Players are able to see which Resources will be successfully yielded from that particular claim. While E-ther and Resource O.U.&#8217;s can be claimed collectively from a Player’s entire portfolio of land, the values obtained from each contributing property will be accumulated on and credited to the original property’s local storage. The collective O.U. values displayed for each Resource may also be hidden or inaccurate if there is no Geologist employed on at least one of the properties. Again, not having a Geologist on a property does not affect the O.U. yield but does affect the insights that are made available for that property.&nbsp;



The claim interface will also display the potential O.U.&#8217;s lost due to detected storage capacity issues if the available E-ther and Resources are claimed as is. “Will fail to store &#8221; is displayed next to any Resource with potential storage issues. Where ‘???’ is displayed in place of a specific O.U. value indicates the property does not have a Geologist who is able to reveal the values for the particular Resource. The ‘View Storage Capacities’ button will redirect Players to the Storage Capacity interface where they will easily be able to identify which property has insufficient capacity for the amount of O.U.&#8217;s that have been extracted.&nbsp;











The system has been designed in a way that Players may also choose to claim their read E-ther separately to their Resources. This is particularly useful when storage issues are detected and the Player is able to claim their E-ther before it evaporates or is raided and still have enough time to fix any storage issues and safely collect their Resource O.U.&#8217;s.&nbsp;











The above method of Resource mining is the easiest way to start yielding Resources from your property. However, there are other strategies and steps you can use to improve the efficiency of your daily Resource yield.&nbsp;



Optimise O.U. yield with Prospecting Cydroids



Prospecting Cydroids can be used to further optimise the Resource production on their properties, as they have more effective Yield power and can extract more O.U.&#8217;s than the Mentar which is limited by comparison. While these First Gen Prospecting Cydroids are able to raid and prospect, they cannot do both simultaneously. If a Prospecting Cydroid is in the middle of a raid-related activity (raiding, dispensing, relocating), the ability to prospect will not be available until the action is completed or aborted. Prospecting Cydroids need power like any other Cydroid and may even run out of Energy whilst Prospecting. A Cydroid Technician on the property will be able to recharge a depleted Prospecting Cydroid which does not have any Yield Power until it is recharged.&nbsp;











E-ther Read Allocation



The ‘Claims Settings’ interface will be the hub for managing the O.U. yield process for each property and is accessible from the Player Profile page or Property Details page. It provides a comprehensive overview of the particulars of O.U. mining.&nbsp;











The system has been designed in a way that once the Resource Yield process is initiated, the allocation of E-ther across all the Resources primed for production whether by the Mentar or Cydroids is automatically distributed evenly. This function ensures an equal distribution of E-ther based on the number of Resources, the active Yield power of the Resources and their frequency categories.&nbsp;



If one Resource has its yield power removed (by unslotting the associated Prime Jewel from the Mentar or the removal of the Cydroids from their prospecting task) the allocation of E-ther will automatically readjust towards the remaining Resources with active Yield power.



Players who prefer a hands-on approach to Resource management can switch to manual mode which will allow them to meticulously configure the E-ther Allocation percentages themselves. However, in Manual mode Resources that lose their Yield power for whatever reason will not trigger an automatic reallocation of E-ther. Instead, the percentage of E-ther that is not allocated to read a Resource will be flagged with an &#8220;unread&#8221; or &#8220;unprospected&#8221; status. To have optimal O.U. yield, all available E-ther should be allocated for reading.&nbsp;



We have designed this system with options that may come in handy if a Player needs to urgently focus on a specific type of Resource production, potentially reacting to global events inside Earth 2 at the time.



Tip: To streamline navigation and enhance user experience with this feature, shortcut icons have been integrated. Selecting the Mentar or Jewel icon will direct Players to the Mentar slotting page, while selecting any Cydroid displayed in the interface will redirect them to the corresponding Cydroid boost overview in the Administration interface.











Managing Your Resource Production



Managing the production of Resource O.U.&#8217;s will be the next challenge for most Players focused on the EcoSim, more specifically resource mining, and potentially more so for those with a large portfolio. It is, therefore, important to understand what areas of the Resource system to keep an eye on and where to find information or functionality for the action that is required to manage Resource production.&nbsp;



MANAGING ON A PORTFOLIO LEVEL











To assist with the overview of Resource O.U. yield across a Player’s entire portfolio, a new filter has been added to the Player Profile to display the ‘Yield Status’ of each property and identify the properties with potential issues that may affect the next yield. Resource icons on each property are highlighted in the colour matching the yield status to quickly identify the Resource/s that need attention.&nbsp;



ColourYield StatusRequired ActionGreenOn TargetNone &#8211; Occurrence Units will successfully be yielded from the next E-ther SpawnYellowReading ReducedCheck Cydroids &#8211;&nbsp; Occurrence Units will be yielded from the next E-ther Spawn BUT one or more Prospecting Cydroids have no Energy to complete their taskRedReading HaltedCharge Cydroids &#8211; Occurrence Units will NOT be yielded from the next E-ther Spawn. All Prospecting Cydroids have no Energy to complete their task.BlackNot ConfiguredOptional &#8211; Configure Prospectors to yield O.U.&#8217;s from the next E-ther Spawn.&nbsp;



Prospecting Cydroids that run out of Power and are unable to prospect for Resource O.U.&#8217;s may be recharged by the resident Cydroid Technician. If no Technician is employed on the property, the Player must manually recharge the Cydroid from the Raid Menu interface (Map -&gt; Raid Menu -&gt; Property -&gt; Charge Cydroids). While a Cydroid Technician may be added to a property to assist with keeping Cydroids charged with Power, Players should remember that one of their primary motives is to acquire the Red Energy that sustains them. Due to this, Red Energy reserves become an important commodity for properties where Players cannot or do not intend to raid from.&nbsp;



In addition to the yield status of each property which can be seen in the Portfolio, Players are able to view all the Resources that are collectively detected across their portfolio of properties and the maximum potential O.U.&#8217;s that can be yielded for each of those Resources under LAND RESOURCES. It is important to note that where there is no Geologist stationed on a property, no O.U. values will have been revealed in order to be accounted for in the aggregated values shared from the system on your portfolio’s LAND RESOURCES page.











Under each Resource, the total number of tiles containing that Resource across all the properties in the portfolio are displayed in Tiers. It is important to be aware that not all tiles within a property will have the same frequency of a particular Resource detected on it. For example, a 100 tile property with overall Copious frequency Limestone may only have 85 tiles which are actually of that specific frequency. Thus a Player may see that a 100 tile property is displayed as 85 tiles Copious, 5 Rich, 2 Sparse, 1 Deficient, and 7 with no Limestone at all. For a detailed explanation, please refer back to the Resource Frequency Category section of this article.



Resource Balance and Resource Transactions can also be found under the Player Profile page under Resources. These sections have been designed to show the aggregated O.U. values of every Resource currently stored in their HoloBuildings, and every single isolated O.U. yield successfully or unsuccessfully stored, respectively. The O.U.&#8217;s displayed in the Resource Balance is a result of our EcoSim system calculating an aggregation of all available data values across the entire portfolio.&nbsp;



Furthermore, while Players have the option to view the total Occurrence Units they have stored across their portfolio, it is important to note that each O.U. is stored locally and cannot be transferred between properties. The Weaver, which will be released in the future, will be able to convert any stored O.U.&#8217;s into physical matter (m3) Raw Materials which may then be transferred between properties using logistics. Earth 2 has plans to introduce an automated system at a later date which will make it possible to process O.U.&#8217;s directly into the Weaver, skipping the need for O.U. storage when this automatic replication process is in place. It is worth noting that there is no ETA on this update including any specifics we can share right now, and there will always be numerous strategic advantages in being able to store O.U.’s.



For now, all O.U.&#8217;s that are extracted must have enough available storage space to be stored. From the profile Resources page, if any Resources have issues with storage space a red warning icon accompanied by red text reading “Capacity” will appear beside the number of properties with the storage space issues affecting the potential yield of the Resource. Selecting ‘View Storage’ will open the storage capacity pop-up pre-filtered to display properties for that particular Resource.











MANAGING ON A PROPERTY LEVEL



The EcoSim system also provides a more granular view of the exact O.U.&#8217;s for each Resource stored in a Property’s HoloBuildings and the current storage capacity, which can both be viewed on the Property Page via the&nbsp; new tab system. The amount of O.U.&#8217;s that have been yielded and are currently stored in balance together with remaining storage capacity on the property are displayed. A shortcut button to access the Claim Settings interface has also been added here for convenience along with an “Edit HoloBuilding” button for quick access to the HoloBuilding Editor. On this page and with the help of a Geologist, Players can see whether the maximum O.U. potential has been met by the predicted daily field. If it has not, further optimisation strategies should be made.&nbsp;











Property Resource data is also conveniently displayed in the Jewel slotting tab for the Mentar. New filters for Resource Type and Frequency Category further assist in identifying the correct properties and Resources that can be primed. Slotting the Mentar with Prime Jewels can boost the Yield Power, though not on the same level as using Prospecting Cydroids.&nbsp; Other Jewels with Resource boost effects may also be slotted into the Mentar but will only contribute to boosting the Mentar’s Yield Power if the Prime Jewel is also slotted.&nbsp;











Strategic Gameplay: Increasing O.U. Yield for Optimal Productivity



In almost everything related to Earth 2, the goal is for Players to positively utilise the full potential of their existing portfolio to get the most out of the time they spend managing it. Simply participating in the EcoSim is easy to do and can be immediately rewarding. But for Players who are looking for maximum gains, the use of skill and strategic finesse is required and often produces handsome returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;



While Earth 2 firmly believes every Earth 2 Player’s experience of and potential in the EcoSim is unique and should therefore be addressed with unique strategies based on their portfolio, the following areas of considerations are provided to help Players understand where they could be more strategic to enhance their personal experiences with Resource production.



A tailored approach to the E-ther Split



One way to maximise the daily Resource O.U. yield is to actively manage the E-ther yield split on properties that have more than 1 Resource being primed for production. The following scenario illustrates a potential strategy that Players could employ:



A property has a max value of 1000 O.U. Limestone and 1000 O.U. Gold and the E-ther spawn on a particular day is 10 E-ther. The Landowner decides to read all (100%) of the E-ther spawn for Limestone O.U.&#8217;s. In this case, none of the 1000 Gold O.U.&#8217;s contained in the E-ther will be stored as the E-ther is only read for Limestone O.U.&#8217;s.&nbsp;



To update the E-ther split again, the Landowner must wait for the next E-ther spawn to reallocate the Resource read percentages. A new day arrives and a new E-ther spawn occurs. The Landowner now decides to read half (50%) of the E-ther Spawn for Limestone and the other half (50) for Gold. The landowner now has a maximum potential yield of 500 O.U. Limestone (half of Limestone) and 500 O.U. Gold (half of Gold).&nbsp;



In each of the cases above where the Landowner has focused 100% of the E-ther to be read for the chosen Resources, Yield Power is still needed in order to achieve the maximum potential yield.



Prospecting Cydroids for maximum Yield Power



Prospecting Cydroids will maximise the Yield Power on a property. If a Player has 5 Prospecting Cydroids for Limestone that each have 20% Yield Power, their combined Yield Power would equate to 100% Yield Power. 100% Yield Power means that the landowner may be able to yield the max. O.U. values from the E-ther, resulting in a yield of 1,000 O.U.&#8217;s for&nbsp; Limestone on the first day. If the Landowner only used 1 Prospecting Cydroid with just 20% Yield Power, then the O.U.&#8217;s from the E-ther spawn would be read by that Cydroid. However, they will only manage to yield&nbsp; 20% of the 1,000 O.U.&#8217;s for Limestone.



In the case where the Landowner only allocates 50% of the E-ther through a prospecting Cydroid, the yield power cannot obtain the properties Max O.U.&#8217;s. Instead, a single Cydroid with 20% Yield Power reading 50% of the E-ther’s O.U.&#8217;s for Limestone will result in a 10% Effect Power of the maximum O.U. which equates to 100 Limestone O.U.&#8217;s from that yield.&nbsp;



Strategic thinking will be involved to determine what percentage of&nbsp; E-ther should be read for which Resource and how many Prospecting Cydroids to assign for each Resource. The Mentar only has Yield Power as long as a Prime Jewel is slotted. Both the Mentar and Cydroids can be boosted with additional Yield Power through Jewels.



These dynamic systems will come in handy when Players need to focus on specific Resources for their empire or world events.



Mentars vs. Prospecting Cydroids



D1 &#8211; D6 Resources can be yielded by either the Mentar (using Prime Jewels) or Prospecting Cydroids specialised in the appropriate Resource. It is optional to use either both the Mentar and Prospecting Cydroids, or just the Cydroid for Resource O.U.&#8217;s. For example, a Landowner may slot an Ochre Jewel to prime the Mentar for Iron and collect O.U.&#8217;s only through the Mentar or they may opt to use Prospecting Cydroids in addition to or exclusively without the Mentar.&nbsp;



D7 -D9 Resources can only be prospected by the Prospecting Cydroid so priming the Mentar alone will not produce a successful yield unless paired with a Prospecting Cydroid. The Land Upgrade system provides an opportunity for Players to upgrade their properties, enhancing its ability and unlocking higher Discovery Tier Resources.



Backdated Resource O.U.s: The 1000 m3 HoloBuilding Promise



As a major fulfilment of a highly complex promise Earth 2 made in 2021, Players who opted to dive into the HoloBlueprints system and took part in the Backdating campaign leading up to the release of the Resource system have received their backdated Resources from Earth 2. Although extremely complicated, and admittedly the Resource release was behind schedule, this update reflects our continued commitment and dedication to deliver on promises we made to our Players in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;



While this may in some ways seem as though participating Players were given a head start in this EcoSim Resource, in actuality this is the direct product of&nbsp; and reward for the time and effort these Players have put into Earth 2 by actively participating in the emerging EcoSim over the years.&nbsp;



The calculation of these backdated Resource O.U.&#8217;s have been solely influenced by the Mentar, and any Jewels slotted in the Mentar, and considerately bypasses the Land Tier restrictions which are applied to the standard O.U. yield process for Players who participated. This is how, for example, some D7-D9 Resource O.U.&#8217;s have been collected from Tier 2 properties which typically do not support mining D7-D9 Resources. However, with the backdated Resources now fulfilled, Players must meet the Tier requirements in order to continue yielding the desired Resource O.U.&#8217;s.&nbsp;



We believe that the underlying reward of these backdated Resources will contribute towards unprecedented opportunities for construction and development within Earth 2 for these participating Players as the EcoSim evolves. With the allocation of 1000 m3 maximum backdated HoloBuilding storage capacity per property, which is equivalent to 10 million O.U.&#8217;s, the opportunities for creation and P2P trading for these Players is significant. To put this into perspective, it only costs E$1.00 to construct a Holobuilding equivalent to 1000m3 which can store an&nbsp; allocation of 10 million O.U.&#8217;s. If you happened to completely fill such a HoloBuilding during the backdate period we can provide a general guideline that once processed into Raw Materials and Building Blocks, a mixture of 10 million varying Resource O.U.’s will be enough to construct approximately one of the following examples:




Over 100 Residential Houses



Over 50 Apartments



Over 5 High-Rise Buildings



Over 2 Skyscrapers



Over 40 Small Factories




The 1000 m3 HoloBuilding storage cap was only applicable to the backdated Resource promise. Now that Players can mine Resources directly from their properties, Landowners may very well yield and store much more than 1000 m3 if their storage capacity allows. Players who received their backdated Resources may also now choose to increase the storage size of their HoloBuildings to continue collecting more O.U.&#8217;s and even use Prospecting Cydroids to mine O.U.&#8217;s much more effectively than slotted Mentars.&nbsp;



Once we have the foundations well and truly set and functioning, Earth 2 will begin exploring other types of buildable or discoverable mechanics to increase the pace of O.U. yield, providing alternatives that each come with their own trade-offs to encourage further strategic gameplay. This is in line with our vision to offer diversified options for Earth 2 players catering to various EcoSim strategies and preferences.



The Bazaar: P2P Trading&nbsp;



Along with updated UI to support the entire foundation of the Earth 2 EcoSim Resource system, changes have also been made to the Bazaar to make trading of Resource production focused digital items more convenient.&nbsp;



Prospecting Cydroids can be purchased from the Cydroid bazaar with convenient filter and sort options to quickly find the Prospecting Cydroid required for specific Resource production needs. Players who choose to purchase Prospecting Cydroids can potentially bypass the time required if they were to build the Cydroid themselves and obtain the correct Prime Jewel required for the fuse. Players who choose to sell Prospecting Cydroids can benefit from the demand and may even dedicate their EcoSIm efforts into creating and supplying Prospecting Cydroids for other EcoSim Players. Listed Cydroids can be filtered by the associated Resource or number of Resource slots available, and sorted by the Cydroid’s Resource Yield power.&nbsp;











Once a Prospecting Cydroid is selected for purchase from the Bazaar, the list of properties available for the new Cydroid to tether to will conveniently only contain properties that have the Resource the Cydroid can prospect for. This is also a safety feature to eliminate the potential for Players to accidentally purchase and place a Prospecting Cydroid on a property where they cannot be used for Resource production.&nbsp;











Each Prospecting Cydroid listing will display the Resource it is specialised in. The back of the listing contains further details about the Cydroid’s Resource Yield power and number of Special Fuse boost slots (Resource slots).&nbsp;











Geologist Civilians&nbsp; may be purchased directly from the Bazaar and are a great option for Players looking to bypass the synthesis time (1 day), save their E-ther or obtain a Geologist that has already reached the XP Level that is required for the Resource they wish to mine. The XP Level of each Civilian can be found by using the Occupation and XP Level filters.











The back of the listing will also detail the Civilian’s current XP Level and the amount of XPs they would need to reach the next XP Level.&nbsp;











Blueprints &amp; HoloBuilding listings have now been updated to display their O.U. storage capacities in the Bazaar. Whether a Player is short on time, is not interested in learning the HB Editor system, is looking for a beautiful design they do not have the capacity to create themselves, or all of the above, there is a HoloBuilding offered on the Bazaar to meet all those needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;















Players may purchase either HoloBuildings or Blueprints from the Bazaar but each of these licence types vary in how they can be used. Additionally, when purchasing HoloBuildings, Players must check that the size of the HoloBuilding is compatible with the size and shape of the property they intend to construct their HoloBuilding on.&nbsp;



Utilising the additional filters is the best way to quickly and easily find the HoloBuilding or Blueprint based on the footprint size and dimensions of the property, as well as the price range Players are looking in.&nbsp;















When selecting a HoloBuilding or Blueprint to purchase, Players should also be aware that they are purchasing the model or design itself, to the owner/creator of the HoloBlueprint. The construction cost of a HoloBuilding on a property is E$0.01 per m3, please remember to check the construction cost before making a purchase.&nbsp;



To learn more about these important details, please read our previous announcement here.



Changes to previous announcements:&nbsp;



Our major update introduced the concept of Land Resources, revolutionising how Players will interact with their virtual properties. We acknowledge that some changes implemented in this version of the Resource system have diverged from our initial game design (detailed here), but these were necessary steps towards a more immersive, dynamic and sustainable Earth 2 EcoSim experience.



For the most part, the below updates and adjustments have been made with the Player in mind, making the system more streamlined, convenient and/or advantageous.



Previously Prospecting Cydroids were said to be required to successfully dispense the E-ther into the Mentar before the Occurrence Units would be accounted for.



Now we clarify that when Cydroids are collecting native E-ther from the Landowner’s property, as this E-ther is directly bound to the property, Cydroids are able to directly transfer the collected E-ther and read O.U.&#8217;s to the Mentar without the dispensing process being required. The dispensing requirement previously shared is a process that will only be required when attempting to bind foreign (raided) E-ther to the base property and will be involved in a future update to the system.&nbsp;



Previously the Mentar was said to only be able to read Resources belonging to Discovery Tier 1 and at a reduced yield rate.&nbsp;



Now we have updated the system so that the Mentar is able to read up to and including Discovery Tier 6 Resources out of the initial 32 Resources officially released by Earth 2. Specialised Cydroids will continue to always have the advantage of stronger Yield Power over the Mentar when it comes to prospecting O.U.&#8217;s.



Previously the Head E-ther Reckoner was said to play a crucial role for Players to gain insights on their local O.U. storage capacity to ensure that enough storage space is maintained for the Occurrence Units Players were hoping to collect.



Now after carefully considering the balance of simple vs complex gameplay, we have introduced the separate Geologist Civilian who will allow Players to gain O.U. Insights of the property they are on, with many more Civilians planned for the future. Therefore, we shifted the role that the Head Reckoner was planned for and made adjustments for potential future use rather than for revealing insights of local O.U. storage capacities.&nbsp;



Future updates and pending fixes



Given the sheer size of the EcoSim Resource system there have been a few issues resulting from the release which the Earth 2 team are currently working on resolving and optimising, if they have not already done so. For any Players who are experiencing any unresolved bugs we kindly ask for your continued patience and understanding while our dev team works on resolving them.&nbsp;



If you are experiencing any bugs, please report them to https://support.earth2.io so that our dev team can continue to work through and resolve them.&nbsp;



In the days and weeks following the release of this system, our team has also collected the feedback and suggestions made by our Players on future improvements we can make to enhance the experience for everyone. If you have a suggestion or constructive criticism you would like to share, please direct these to our Community Manager or submit a ticket at https://support.earth2.io .&nbsp;



Some features and components were also intentionally left out of this initial release of the Resource system. The function of raiding and losing O.U.&#8217;s has been excluded in this version and is planned to be added in the next version instead. Raiding E-ther and losing E-ther will continue to function as per the existing mechanics.&nbsp;



The Weaver which has been revealed in previous announcements will also be released in a later version of the system to allow for the complexities of the feature. The Weaver, along with Essence, is essential for crafting raw materials from collected Resource O.U.&#8217;s and is, therefore, something Players should look forward to.&nbsp;



Closing Thoughts&nbsp;



The Earth 2 EcoSim Resource System marks a significant stride in our long term vision, laying a powerful foundation for an expansive, player-driven geolocational Metaverse. This intricate system marks the beginning of a new era. It forms the backbone of Earth 2’s evolving EcoSim, enabling Players to harness and optimise resources that will ultimately shape the world around them. With each new component, from Prospecting Cydroids to Resource Occurrence Units, we’re moving closer to an ecosystem where strategic depth, collaboration, and innovation become the driving forces.



As Earth 2 enters this new phase, Players are invited to transform not just properties, but legacies—are you mining the foundations to build a dynasty, securing a platform that will help you join, form, or even make or break alliances, or are you solely determined on creating bustling centres of trade and commerce? These early steps hint at the opportunities that lie ahead, paving the way for megacities, trade empires, and new forms of global cooperation, or domination, and at the centre of it all is the ever-expanding utility and need of Power, the need of Essence.&nbsp;



The next EcoSim era has dawned, bringing a world rich with possibilities for those ready to lead, build, and lay down their mark in history inside Earth 2 forever. 



We’ll leave you with a unique insight—a glimpse we may not make so easily available very often, so consider this a rare opportunity to gauge the current status of accumulated O.U.’s globally. We present, the current aggregated total of O.U.’s stored across Earth 2:






In 2025 we plan to embark on the next step of the EcoSim journey with the introduction of Raw Material production using Essence, Transportation, Building Blocks, Logistics and the very first Buildings!



We thank our community for your unwavering support, commitment, and passion as we embark on this journey together and continue to develop the Geolocational Metaverse &#8211; Earth 2. 



Stay tuned as we continue to unlock Earth 2’s vast potential—one step at a time!















Join the journey, shape the future. Earth 2, the People’s Metaverse.

Title: Earth 2 Creation Process Series &#8211; Volume 1 &#8211; The Skeleton Warrior
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/11/20/creation-process-vol-1/

====================================================================================================
November 20, 2024 – Sydney, Australia – We’re pleased to introduce the Creation Process Series, a behind-the-scenes look at the meticulous process of creating our unique 3D assets here at Earth 2. This series highlights key moments condensed from hours of recorded footage, demonstrating the dedication and artistry involved in crafting characters, objects and creatures for the Earth 2 Metaverse which have originated from our internal concept art pipeline. The first video in this series focuses on the Skeleton Warrior, one of the first revealed enemy units designed and developed for Earth 2 Hordes and the open E2V1 world.



Why We’re Creating This Series



The Creation Process Series aims to give our community insight into the work that goes into building Earth 2. Over the years, we’ve received questions and, at times, accusations of &#8220;asset flipping,&#8221; a practice where pre-made and often stolen assets are reused in games. 



To clarify, it is understandable for projects to use pre-made assets as placeholders to quickly prototype—something we occasionally do at Earth 2, so long as we have legally purchased or obtained the rights to use them.&nbsp;However, we’d like to make it clear that Earth 2 invests a significant amount of time, effort and funds into designing and developing our own custom characters, objects, and creatures, effectively creating our own IP for Earth 2. While there may be some exceptions we make for the use of external assets, so long as we have obtained the legal rights to do so and it aligns with our desired result, the vast majority of final assets used by us inside E2V1 are unique and custom-made by our talented team of artists and developers.



This video series is our way of showcasing the effort behind the scenes for those curious about our work. While we’re releasing this first video now, it’s important to note that it was recorded months ago, and we already have six more videos finished and ready for release. Often what you see now is not always what the team has been actively working on over the past few days, weeks and possibly months.



Creating assets like the Skeleton Warrior is a direct result of funds raised from cosmetic skin sales—just as we promised. These funds allow us to expand our development efforts and build the essential pieces needed to bring Earth 2 to life and make it a unique place &#8211; so thank you for the support!



The 3D Asset Creation Process



Each of our 3D assets is created through a detailed, multi-step process to ensure quality, originality, and functionality within the Earth 2 Metaverse. Below, we break down the steps that went into creating characters like the Skeleton Warrior after the concept art pipeline was approved:



1. High-Poly Sculpting in ZBrush




Base Mesh Creation:

Use ZSpheres for quick blocking of proportions for bones (Skeletons) or humanoid shapes (Zombies).



Alternatively, start with a pre-made base mesh for faster workflows.





Dynamesh the Base Mesh:

Merge ZSpheres into a single sculptable mesh using Dynamesh. Adjust resolution for detailed sculpting.





Primary Shapes:

Use tools like ClayBuildup or Move to shape major forms.



Focus on skeletal structures for Skeletons and muscle or decay layers for Zombies.





Secondary Details:

Add cracks, chips, and anatomical details for Skeletons. Sculpt decayed skin and wounds for Zombies.





Tertiary Details:

Fine textures like pores, scars, and wrinkles. Incorporate accessories or clothing remnants using ZBrush’s tools.





Polish and Optimize:

Use ZRemesher for better topology and ensure the model is game-ready.






2. Retopology in Maya




Export High-Poly Mesh:

Optimize using Decimation Master in ZBrush and export for handling in Maya.





Retopology:

Use Maya’s Quad Draw to create a clean low-poly mesh.



Ensure proper edge loops for smooth deformation in joints.





Optimize Mesh:

Target optimal poly counts (~20k triangles).



Check for clean topology and avoid unnecessary geometry.





UV Unwrapping:

Use Maya’s UV Editor for unwrapping with priority on detailed areas like faces and wounds.



Ensure even texel density and organized UV islands.






3. Baking and Texturing in Substance Painter




Bake High-Poly Details:

Import low- and high-poly meshes into Substance Painter.



Bake Normal, AO, and Curvature maps to transfer details from the high-poly model.





Base Textures:

Use smart materials for base layers (bone for Skeletons, skin for Zombies).





Detail Painting:

Add dirt, decay, and damage using procedural masks and custom brushes.





Final Effects:

Create glowing eyes or wet effects with emissive and roughness maps.





Export Textures:

Generate game-ready textures (Albedo, Normal, Roughness, etc.) at appropriate resolutions.






Earth 2’s 3D Asset Pipeline Starts with Concept Art



As previously outlined in our articles, video descriptions, and announcements, every 3D asset at Earth 2 begins its journey with concept art, which serves as the foundation of our creative process. The initial design is drafted by our concept artists and undergoes multiple reviews and iterations to ensure it aligns with Earth 2’s vision and aesthetic. Once finalised and approved, the design progresses to the next stage of the pipeline: 3D modelling.



A Streamlined Process



Concept Art: Initial designs are created, reviewed, and refined until final approval.



3D Modelling: The approved concept is sculpted into a high-poly model, then optimized into a low-poly version for game performance. The 3D modeller has some freedom to change or improve the look so long as they stay close to the original approved concept art.



UV Mapping and Texturing: The 3D team finalizes the model with detailed UV mapping and texture baking, ensuring a polished look.



Skinning, Rigging, and Weight Painting: Models are prepared for animation by adding skeletons and weights for proper movement.



Animation and QA: Rigged models are tested with animations, reviewed for issues like clipping, and fine-tuned for flawless performance.



Final Approval: A game developer ensures the asset is fully optimised and ready for integration into E2V1.



For those interested, here is the original concept art for our Skeleton Warrior. As mentioned earlier, our 3D modellers are granted some flexibility to enhance or refine the asset’s design, provided it stays true to the original concept. When compared to the video below, you’ll notice that the 3D modeller made a few minor adjustments to the design in certain in some areas.









Overall, you can see that the end result matches closely with the original concept art.



What’s Next



The Skeleton Warrior is just the beginning of this series and as mentioned, this video is the first in a lineup of six more showcasing the creation of other 3D assets and other characters that will populate Earth 2. These videos not only highlight the progress we’ve made but also demonstrate our commitment to original, high-quality asset creation and establishing our own IP for Earth 2.



We hope this series offers valuable insight to those interested in our process and reassures our community of the authenticity and effort behind every character and object our team creates. Stay tuned as we continue to release more videos showcasing the artistry and dedication that will slowly form the Earth 2 Metaverse!



Watch the first video now and step inside the world of Earth 2’s asset creation process!

Title: Earth 2 Hordes Combat Mechanics Volume 2
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2024/11/26/combat-mechanics-volume-2/

====================================================================================================
November 26, 2024 – Sydney, Australia &#8211; Welcome to Earth 2 Hordes Combat Mechanics Volume 2! In this article, we’re excited to highlight some of the updates our team has been testing for the Earth 2 Hordes mini-game. These developments are not only integral to Earth 2 Hordes but will also play a crucial role in the broader open world of E2V1.



As a reminder, the footage featured in this video represents unfinished, work-in-progress updates &#8211; they are not a polished end product! The purpose of this footage release is to provide our community with an inside look at what some of the team members have been working on and the progress they’ve made.



Earth 2 Hordes and the Future of E2V1



Earth 2 is building a geolocational metaverse, a 1:1 scale digital Earth that is geologically accurate and reset to pristine condition. Players can own their own part of this world via land ownership which already provides various forms of utility, such as mining E-ther, extracting 32 different resources, collecting Jewels, launching raids, and more.



We envision Earth 2 as a metaverse with diverse opportunities, from manufacturing, trade, and construction in the EcoSim to hosting games and experiences, all with the ability to take place on Player-owned land. Mini-games like Earth 2 Hordes are designed specifically to expand utility for land, Essence, and Resources. We want landowners to eventually have the ability to host games on their properties, set prizes, and even charge entry fees should they wish to do so.



In the short term, this approach enables us to continue to build, test, and refine key systems we are going to need as we progress toward our unchanged long-term vision &#8211; a metaverse based on the real world filled with megacities, alliances, retail, commerce, and countless other opportunities.



Key Updates in Combat Mechanics Volume 2



As noted earlier, it is important to emphasise that this video showcases unfinished, work-in-progress updates to our combat system. Its purpose is to offer our community insight into what we are currently focusing on and how these systems are evolving. To provide additional context, we will include a brief explanation for each feature demonstrated in the video. Please also keep in mind that the footage featured was recorded approximately 7 weeks ago.



Health, Stamina, and Mana



Progress continues on the health and stamina bar systems, with the addition of a Mana bar to expand gameplay mechanics. If you observe the stamina bar closely, you’ll notice that stamina decreases when the avatar performs special attacks or runs at high speed. Once the stamina bar is fully depleted, the Player will no longer be able to run fast or execute special attacks until they either rest or acquire a stamina potion to replenish it.



AI Perimeter Detection



Our team has been actively developing and testing AI perimeter detection to enhance enemy responsiveness. This system enables AI enemy units to react dynamically to their surroundings, such as detecting nearby threats &#8211; in this case, the avatar. Various scenarios have been tested, including the avatar being detected when in close proximity. The avatar can also be detected at a distance as is demonstrated in the final battle scene of the video, where Skeleton Warrior enemy AI engages upon visually detecting the avatar from afar.



Unit Collisions



In the video, you may notice zombies physically pushing the avatar during interactions. This highlights that unit collisions are active across all entities on the terrain and have been successfully integrated into the multiplayer environment. Not showcased in Vol.2, following the recording of this video, we implemented additional scripts to disable collisions during special attacks. This adjustment allows the avatar to attack seamlessly through groups of enemies without interference.



Updated Katana VFX



As promised in Combat Mechanics Volume 1, new visual effects (VFX) for the Katana have been implemented. The Dash and Slash, Combo Strike, and Skyfall Strike all feature updated VFX, adding a more polished feel. We were also testing Area of Effect (AoE) mechanics specifically for the Combo Strike at the time of recording.



AI Reactive Enemy Speed



Our team has been testing reactive speed mechanics for enemy AI, where units dynamically adjust their movement speed based on their proximity to the avatar. For example, the zombie begins with a slower run but transitions to a faster pace when the avatar speeds up and attempts to gain distance. This creates a more engaging and realistic chase dynamic during combat encounters.



Mixed Enemy Units



The footage also includes early testing of mixed enemy units engaging the avatar simultaneously. This allowed us to evaluate how different enemy types interact in combat and how they contribute to the overall gameplay experience when fighting together.



Enemy Item Drops



During the video, you may notice enemies dropping items upon being defeated. This was part of testing an early version of the enemy drop system, which will serve as the foundation for all future drops, including weapons, skins, and other unique objects. This system is designed to enrich gameplay by providing tangible rewards for defeating enemies.







Zombie Development and Animations



A significant amount of effort goes into the creation of every asset within Earth 2.&nbsp; In Creation Process Volume 1, we showcased the extensive work involved in crafting an enemy like the Skeleton Warrior. However, the process doesn’t stop there &#8211; these creations must also undergo rigging, animation, AI programming, and numerous other steps. Many of our processes and pipelines have been detailed in previous articles and videos, highlighting the depth and complexity required to bring these characters to life.



Zombie Animations



The following animations were created specifically for the Zombie:




Fidget



Jump Attack



Knockback



Run Attack



Idle



Attack 3



Battle Roar



Left Dodge



Left Walk



Right Dodge



Right Walk



Attack 1



Death



Left Run



Right Run



Forward Run



Turn Left



Get Hit



Turn Right



Backward Dodge



Forward Walk




While creating these custom animations requires a substantial investment of time and effort, they play a crucial role in enhancing the overall battle experience for the Player. These animations will be progressively integrated into enemy AI, adding depth and dynamism to combat encounters.



Zombie Mechanics



In addition to its custom animations, the development team implemented various mechanics for the Zombie, including dynamic speed, health, attack values, buffs, and item drops. While the Zombie may have lower health compared to other enemy units, its speed and strength in numbers &#8211; particularly when blending into a crowd &#8211; make it a formidable threat. Players who find themselves surrounded by a group of Zombies risk taking significant damage, especially if they lose control of the situation.













Looking Ahead



The updates shown in Combat Mechanics Volume 2 are not only vital for Earth 2 Hordes but also contribute to the foundation of E2V1’s open-world systems. These developments align with our long-term vision of a metaverse rich with opportunities for Players to create, trade, and compete.



In Combat Mechanics Volume 3, we’ll be introducing:




a new weapon type



a new enemy unit



a sneak peek at the highly anticipated Power Strike, a feature specifically teased at by the Earth 2 Founder in the Combat Mechanics Vol.1 article that will transform the combat system and elevate gameplay to new heights.




Thank you for your continued support as we work to bring the vision of Earth 2 to life. Together, we’re shaping the future of the metaverse one step at a time. Stay tuned!

December 1, 2024 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Welcome to the fifth and final installment in the Earth 2 Megacities and Tile Art series. This series has been a celebration of the creativity and vision of our community, showcasing Player-owned properties, planned megacities, and intricate tile art displayed in our developing 1:1 scale digital Earth, Earth 2 Version 1 (E2V1).



This video series was created as a tribute to Player Creativity in response to requests from our community members eager to see their properties rendered inside E2V1. We’ve curated this showcase to highlight some of the locations submitted by Land Owners on some of our Social accounts.







What’s Impressive About This Footage?



All footage has been recorded in real-time, directly from our 510,072,000 km² digital Earth, a geologically accurate 1:1 scale replica of the real world. The technical achievements behind this showcase are a testament to the power and possibilities of the Earth 2 Engine. 



Here are some of the key highlights worth taking note of while viewing the footage:




Perfectly Positioned Tiles on Geologically Accurate Terrain

This footage highlights the precision with which thousands of Player-owned tiles and flags are displayed simultaneously on screen in real-time.



The terrain you see in the footage is not procedurally generated terrain but rather geologically accurate terrain formations where each tile is mapped with exact precision, matching real-world topography. This alone is a feat that required extensive technological development and remains a standout feature of Earth 2.







Streaming Thousands of Tiles in Real-Time

The ability to stream thousands of approximately 19mx19m tiles in real-time, with perfect accuracy, and each with their own set of datapoints which help to display property borders, flag types, location details and ownership.



The footage demonstrates how our engine can handle immense amounts of data while maintaining seamless performance with aesthetically acceptable visuals. This level of precision ensures that every Player’s property is displayed exactly as intended, even when viewed from impressive view distances.





Impressive View Distances from High Altitudes

The footage showcases Player tiles rendered and streamed from well above the Earth’s surface, providing breathtaking perspectives on large-scale megacities and tile art. The ability to seamlessly display this scale and accuracy at such altitudes demonstrates the robustness and scalability of our evolving engine.





Terrain Collision, Biomes and Property Data

In each megacity featured in the footage, we try to highlight several key technological achievements. The camera typically zooms in, placing an avatar or vehicle onto the terrain, showcasing the ability of our engine to handle real-time interaction with geologically accurate terrain. While moving in real-time, we toggle various systems such as biomes (trees, bushes, grass), seasons, flags, and property data, demonstrating the seamless operation of these massive data systems in real time.



This process highlights not only the precision of the engine but also its power and responsiveness. Viewers can see the terrain collision which enables avatars or vehicles to be placed anywhere in the 510,072,000km2 world and interact naturally with the environment. This terrain collision demonstrates a strong foundation for future gameplay mechanics.



Additionally, during avatar drops, we demonstrate further interactivity with features such as Cydroids. The avatar’s plasma gun or rocket launcher can target and engage these entities, as well as interact directly with the terrain, emphasising the engine&#8217;s ability to manage dynamic, real-time interactions while rendering massive datasets like biomes, terrain and property details.






While some of the capabilities mentioned above may appear standard in general game development, their implementation within a 510,072,000 km² geographically accurate map presents significantly greater challenges.Earth 2’s ability to achieve this emphasises the innovation at the heart of Earth 2’s development and demonstrates the platform&#8217;s technical sophistication providing a glimpse of the possibilities that await Players in the vast, immersive world of E2V1 as our team continue to develop, expand and improve.

A Look Ahead



We’d like to thank our community for providing such amazing content! It has been a privilege to bring this series to life, highlighting the incredible creativity and vision of our community. The possibilities for transforming megacities, tile art, and properties into dynamic, interactive experiences are endless.



Our team is heavily focused on the public release of E2V1, scheduled for January 2025. As a result, we appreciate your understanding regarding the reduced frequency of updates recently and during this critical development period. We are sure our community would like to get their hands on E2V1 above all other things at this point in time!



With E2V1’s release approaching, Volume 5 will serve as the final installment in this series for the time being as soon Players will be able to record their own footage and content directly within the platform! Having said this, we may revisit this series in the future to highlight new megacity developments and tile art updates as the world of Earth 2 continues to evolve.

Title: The Dawn of Life in Earth 2: Character Synthesis in E2V1
URL: https://earth2dotio.wordpress.com/2025/04/06/dawn-of-life/

====================================================================================================
April 6, 2025 &#8211; Sydney, Australia &#8211; Earth 2 is preparing to welcome its very first inhabitants leading into Chapter 1 Pre-Alpha release &#8220;Explore. Craft. Survive.&#8221; With the introduction of the Character Synthesis system inside E2V1, the first true spark of life is preparing to ignite the activity inside the geolocational Metaverse of Earth 2. This foundational system signifies more than just the ability to control an avatar, it represents the beginning of lifeforms, one born from the ownership of land, the technology of the Mentar and the enigmatic resource known as E-ther.



This feature release will allow Players to breathe life into characters that can explore, survive, interact, and grow within an un-spoilt, 1:1 scale virtual Earth. These characters are beings that will face consequence, mortality and purpose.



Before exploring the detailed mechanics of this system, it is important to provide clarity around the philosophy and expectations behind it and other early system designs emerging inside E2V1. Earth 2 is not a typical video game; it is a visual platform with a living, evolving world undergoing continual development and refinement. The sheer scale and complexity of simulating a persistent, globally scaled metaverse introduces a level of unpredictability that demands ongoing balance.



As such, while every effort will be made to ensure that our features and systems for this feature release, but also others both historically and in the future, are stable, it is important to acknowledge that changes may be necessary over time. Game balancing &#8211; especially on a metaverse scale of this magnitude &#8211; can take years. There will be adjustments. But any modifications will be made with careful consideration and a commitment to the long-term stability of the platform.







Life Begins: Synthesising Your Character



The time has come to give birth to the first inhabitants of Earth 2. With the rollout of the Character Synthesis system, players will be granted the ability to create their own lifeforms &#8211; characters that will walk, live, struggle, and thrive across the expansive 510,072,000 km2 lands and seas of this pristine digital Earth.



The act of creating life in Earth 2 carries weight. It brings with it the need for responsibility, care, and survival. Characters are mortal. They can die. Their lives can be cut short by reckless choices, environmental dangers, neglect or sometimes just bad luck.



But if players approach their journey with mindfulness and purpose, their characters have the chance to go on to live long, meaningful and productive lives. Life inside Earth 2 is intended to have value. It is meant to accentuate experiences inside E2V1 making them more significant and to make actions more deliberate given those decisions can often face consequences. Essentially, the presence of risk &#8211; and the opportunity for potential reward &#8211; injects true purpose into every decision and true care for every action.



This is the beginning of digital sentience within Earth 2. The act of synthesis is not a click or a casual function &#8211; it is a moment of creation and you as the Player are in control. The very first breath of life into a world long silent. A future defined by every player’s action, one life at a time.







E-ther is Life



Since its discovery, E-ther has been a curious and mysterious substance in Earth 2. Known to naturally evaporate from Player owned land and to possibly appear from other sources inside E2V1, it has become one of the most important elements in the metaverse. While players have learned to capture and transform it into Essence &#8211; a power source with tradeable utility &#8211; E-ther&#8217;s true potential has always hinted at something deeper.



Now, that potential is slowly being realised. E-ther is alive.



To synthesise a character &#8211; a lifeform with a tangible presence inside Earth 2 &#8211; Players will need to use E-ther as the fundamental catalyst. The initial lifeform they create will be known as an E-ther lifeform, unique in its origin and tied intrinsically to the land and systems from which it was born.



Character synthesis requires a Mentar located on Tier 2 land or higher. However, the process is not limited to what a Mentar holds locally. Instead, Players can draw from their global aggregate balance of E-ther to perform the synthesis. This allows flexibility in how and where a Player chooses to create life so long as they have the correct Tier land and Mentar available.



During synthesis, Players will also be able to choose the biological archetype of their new lifeform &#8211; selecting between XX and XY E-ther-based genetic lifeforms. This choice may have future implications as the metaverse continues to expand and evolve.



The introduction of E-ther lifeforms adds depth to the lore of Earth 2 while reinforcing the notion that life within this world is not without cost and not without meaning.



In a world where everything is connected &#8211; land, energy, matter, and soul &#8211; E-ther is the invisible strand that binds lifeforms together. Through it, Players do not just create avatars. They create possibilities.

Your character is now alive!







Synthesis Rates and Economic Balancing



Creating life inside Earth 2 is not a flat transaction. It is governed by a carefully constructed internal algorithm that introduces dynamic pricing based on a Base Synthesisation Value, or BSV. This BSV is linked directly to the external traded value of Essence &#8211; the more valuable Essence becomes, the less E-ther is required to synthesise a character, and vice versa. It’s a self-balancing economic loop that maintains equilibrium between what will become some of Earth 2’s most vital resources.



While some Players may be able to determine what the BSV is, it is not publicly published and may be changed from time to time. If the actual BSV is changed, it will be clearly communicated to Players. It is important to note, however, that routine fluctuations in the E-ther amount to synthesise life, in the absence of any such announcement, will solely reflect real-time changes in the external value of Essence.



Not all land is created equal, the amount of E-ther needed to synthesise a character also varies depending on the Tier and Class of the land your Mentar is located on. Tier 2 land will require 100% E-ther based on the BSV, serving as the baseline for comparison. Other land classes &#8211; such as Tier 1 with premium tile classes &#8211; will offer reductions to this base cost, rewarding strategic land holders of their acquisition and ownership.



Importantly, every unit of E-ther used to synthesise a character is automatically transformed into Essence and permanently burned at a rate of 100%. This rate may change in the future but for now will remain at 100% burn. This not only introduces a deflationary mechanic to the system but also reinforces the significance and permanence of the act of creation. When you choose to create life, that decision not only brings new opportunities but echoes throughout the economy.



To provide a guideline to Players, at the current external value of Essence at $0.0367 it would require approximately 21 E-ther to synthesise a character. This amount of E-ther will reduce if the value of Essence increases or increase if the value of Essence decreases so long as the BSV is not adjusted.



Free to Play: A Cooperative Path to Life



Free to Play on Earth 2 is more than access &#8211; it’s a cooperative opportunity wrapped in trust, merit, and reward. Synthesising a character costs E-ther, but Players who own Tier 1 land can go one step further and offer a lifeline by providing the necessary E-ther for another Player to create a character. In doing so, they effectively sponsor a new life inside Earth 2.



Characters synthesised under this system are initially bound to the landowner-Player who provided the E-ther. The Free to Play player gains control of the character and can begin experiencing Earth 2 immediately &#8211; but while they are free to do as they please, complete freedom of their lifeform must be earned.



Qualifying landowners have the option to set a quest or bounty &#8211; perhaps collecting specific materials, supplies or items, returned to a specific location. Whatever the quest is, once it is fulfilled, the free to play character then becomes unbound and fully independent &#8211; free so to speak. Until the quest or bounty is successfully completed, the landowner may set percentage based royalties on any gathered resources, materials or items the bound Player acquires during their time with the sponsored character. Though optional, the landowner may even enforce a time limit to complete the quest, which if ignored or abandoned, may see the character face death.



This system gives rise to a real economy of economy and opportunity. Players with higher class Tier 1 land can have more freedom to set filters for sponsors based on historical performance. Free to Play players who reliably complete quests will build a positive rating, granting them access to higher-tier landowners and more rewarding opportunities.



The first wave of quests will be relatively simple &#8211; gathering materials or crafting supplies and returning them to a set location &#8211; but the system will grow in sophistication over time as the platform expands. In time, the idea is for it to encompass building, land management and other cooperative world shaping responsibilities.



It is important to note that the Free to Play feature will not be a part of the first release, but rather released in a future version once the foundations of the Character synthesising system have been thoroughly tested and optimised.



Free to Play Players will be able to view a lobby system and execute global searches to identify the Quests, Tiers, Classes, Locations and more, that may appeal to them. Players will also be able to search by EPL so EPL owners can offer specific Quests on a property and promote it externally as well.



In Earth 2, your freedom is earned, your reputation is built, and your journey is forged by the choices you make.



Below is a chart outlining some of the differences Mentars on varying land tier and classes will be able to provide.







Synthesis Amount &#8211; The amount of E-ther required to synthesise a character



Synthesise (Weekly) &#8211; Number of characters that can be synthesised on relevant Mentar weekly.



Quest &#8211; Whether the tier and class is able to set quests in return for free to play character creation.



Quest Type &#8211; The different types of materials or quest types available to be set by the Mentar.



Quantity &#8211; the quantity of material, items or products set in the quest and the maximum reward possible for the materials or quests.



Player History &#8211; Ability to filter player performance history in order to attract Players who have a better history of play and higher chance of successfully fulfilling the quest while also being able to offer better rewards.



Protection &#8211; the protection level a Mentar is able to provide to Players that set up Campfires on the relevant property.



Please note that Quest, Quest Type, Quantity and Player History will be part of a subsequent feature release when free to play becomes available.











Vitals: Health, Stamina, Hunger, Thirst



Every character in Earth 2 will initially be governed by four vital stats: Health, Stamina, Hunger, and Thirst.&nbsp;




Health represents the character’s overall vitality. It can initially be depleted through fall damage, combat, starvation, dehydration or exhaustion.



Stamina fuels movement and high physical activity. When stamina runs out, any continued exertion begins to drain health.



Hunger reflects the need for food. Once depleted, it slowly chips away at health.



Thirst tracks hydration. Like hunger, if ignored, it leads to a gradual loss of life.




Players must carefully manage these vitals. Venture too far without food or water, and your journey may end prematurely. Foraging, crafting, and planning ahead are essential to the survival of your character.







Exploration, Materials, and Crafting



With life synthesised, your journey truly begins. Earth 2’s digital world spans over 510,072,000km2, an accurate mirror of real world geography, yet reset to a pristine state. This untouched canvas is rich with discovery, and survival will hinge on a Player’s ability to forage, craft and adapt.



Over 200 materials will be discoverable across the map at launch. These survival ingredients will gradually expand into a variety of gameplay. Early on, crafting will focus on simple recipes to help players survive, navigate and expand their reach.



Some crafted items will be possible directly from a Mentar, helping players get their footing by converting gathered materials into usable items.







Early Items



To support survival and initial exploration, Earth 2 will allow players to craft a variety of essential gear using materials found in the wild. This includes:




Backpack (for inventory space)



Bottle (for carrying water)



Hat, Shirt, Pants, and Shoes (basic clothing set)



Campfire (temporary save point)



Food (to restore sustenance)



Glider and Wingsuit (for mobility and leisure)




There will also be some additional items &#8211; currently unrevealed &#8211; which will be discoverable by curious and resourceful Players. Recipes for these hidden items must be unlocked through experimentation and adventure.







Cosmetic Skins



Cosmetic skins remain a key component of Player identity inside Earth 2. However, as always planned, to wear a cosmetic outfit, Players must first equip a full set of basic clothing: hat, shirt, pants, and shoes. Once the character is fully clothed, a full-body cosmetic skin can be applied.



Initially, outfit changes will be handled through Mentars. Future updates will introduce portable devices that allow for outfit switching without needing to return to a property.



While modular clothing (individual swappable pieces) is planned, the first iteration will focus on full-skin suits, with more flexibility arriving in future updates.







Death: Consequence in the Metaverse



In Earth 2, life is fragile and death can be permanent. The metaverse is vast, untamed, and teeming with dangers. A character&#8217;s death can occur in numerous ways: from tumbling down a steep mountain slope, to succumbing to hunger or dehydration, to being struck down by wild creatures or hostile foes. Even environmental threats like exhaustion or exposure can lead to a character’s end.



When death occurs, the tile on which your character dies is recorded and the consequences that follow are significant. If the player chooses not to revive, or does not have enough E-ther on their character to do so, the character will die permanently on that spot. All of that character’s inventory will remain discoverable on that tile for 24 hours, and if not retrieved within that time period, it will be lost forever.



Items dropped may include valuable resources: E-ther, Essence, energy, materials, wearables, crafted items, or jewels &#8211; almost everything except for cosmetic skins which will remain with the Player. The option of revival at least gives the Player a choice to instantly revive their character, but if this option is not selected other Players who may happen to explore that tile during the grace period may be able to loot those items for themselves so don’t wait too long before recovering your items!



This mechanic is intended to make death meaningful, even punishing. In Earth 2, recklessness comes with consequences. The metaverse can be a dangerous place and even if your character dies from a bug, it still counts as death. Not even we can reverse it.







Mentar Save



The most secure way to protect your character&#8217;s existence is by saving it inside a Mentar. These structures have the ability to serve as stasis chambers &#8211; places where life can be preserved indefinitely. Each Mentar can only house one saved character at a time, and only characters owned by the landowner may be stored. Free to Play characters cannot currently be saved in Mentars.



There are no expiration timers or ticking clocks. Once stored, a character can remain inside a Mentar indefinitely with all of its inventory, awaiting reactivation. This becomes especially useful for Players who want to explore with different characters in different locations or who need to pause gameplay without risking their progress or survival for that character.



Mentars will remain the primary method of long-term character storage until future EcoSim buildings expand on this functionality.







Campfire: Temporary Survival in the Wild



For those who don’t own land or are venturing far from home, the Campfire offers a vital lifeline. A Campfire allows characters to be saved temporarily and can be built on both unowned and owned land.



On unowned land, a Campfire lasts for 24 hours but can be looted by other Players if discovered. On player owned properties, this default lifespan extends to 72 hours, offering a much needed buffer for exploration and more importantly can offer default protection against looters which increases based on the Tier land and class you set the Campfire on. Campfires built on someone else’s land may incur a fee set by the property owner which will be displayed before the Player tries to build the Campfire.



Each Campfire, whether on owned or unowned land, can store one character and is limited to one specific tile. Larger properties will be able to host multiple Campfires at a rate one per every 10 tiles &#8211; allowing well established landowners to support explorers, allies, or even entire small communities.



But beware, if your Campfire goes out before you return to re-spawn your character, that character dies, and its inventory is left behind on that tile until it is collected, looted or perished.







Re-Spawning



Players can synthesise unlimited Characters inside Earth 2 which will remain alive so long as they are in an active, alive state or safely stored in a Mentar or Campfire. However, only one character can be controlled at any given time.



To manage this, Players will use the in game Character Management system. This interface will allow Players to search and locate their saved characters by name, location, Mentar or Campfire tile. From there, they can re-spawn any living character and take control of it to resume activities inside Earth 2. 



Re-spawning a saved character does not require any E-ther.



Characters that have died will appear under a separate filter, allowing Players to confirm their death and identify the precise location of any dropped inventory.







Revival



If a character dies while actively being played, Players will have a brief 2 minute window to initiate a revival. This revival comes at a cost of double the E-ther required to synthesise a character at that time. As is the case when a character is first synthesised, the E-ther used for revival is automatically transformed into Essence and 100% burned in full.



Another player nearby can also step in to revive your character using their own E-ther, offering moments of camaraderie, alliance, or perhaps even negotiation. But if no revival occurs within those two minutes &#8211; or if the player exits E2V1 during the countdown &#8211; the character dies permanently and the inventory will be dropped on that tile.



If a Player chooses revival, the Character returns with full health, stamina, hunger, and thirst.







App Crash or Connection Drop



Disconnection is a harsh reality in any online world, and Earth 2 has implemented safeguards to manage it.



If your app crashes or your internet connection drops while your character is alive, the system will detect this and begin a five-minute timeout countdown. If you do not reconnect within that timeframe, your character will die.&nbsp;



In these cases, players will have up to 24 hours to revive their character at the standard revival cost. This ensures that technical issues don’t necessarily lead to permanent loss &#8211; but still remains a real threat.



Unfortunately, if your character is however killed within that countdown period the death process will be initiated which means you will need to recovery inventory before another Player looks or the 24 hour recovery window closes.







Day &amp; Night Cycles



Time in Earth 2 is immersive, persistent, and localised. Once a player enters character mode, they are bound to the actual conditions of the region they are in inside E2V1. This includes the time of day, or night, and other possible conditions.



In free-fly mode, Players can experiment with environmental settings &#8211; adjusting sun angles, fog, waves, and more. But in character mode, they become fully immersed in the living simulation and are bound to the environment at that given time and location.



At launch, Earth 2 will implement 6-hour day-night cycles: 4 hours of day, followed by 2 hours of night. This results in four full E2V1 days every 24 real world hours.



Moon phases will also be meaningful, cycling every Earth day and will be important in future gameplay mechanics.



We will not be implementing seasonal changes that align with the real world at present, but will instead progressively test a randomised seasonal system where changes can occur rapidly and unexpectedly. This will allow for faster iteration and feedback in early development. In the future, we may align seasons with real-world hemispheres &#8211; but that decision remains open.







With the arrival of character synthesis, Earth 2 will mark a milestone transition from a vast world of potential to a world of life with all kinds of possibilities. Every decision now carries weight. Your actions, your creations, and your character’s fate will truly be in your hands!



Thank you for taking the time to read this article. We&#8217;re very excited about the future potential of the systems and mechanics provided in this article and the impact they may have long term for Earth 2.
