Alteration includes propylitic, dominated by chlorite and epidote with silicification and pyritization. Valja Strz and Dumitru Potok deposits are relatively large but of sub-marginal grades; epithermal mineralization developed at the margins of these bodies (Porter GeoConsultancy, 2011). Porter GeoConsultancy (2011) reports that the plutons are generally potassic, and strontium 87Sr/86Sr ratios indicate a continental crust contaminated mantle source.

The discovery was followed by soil sampling, geophysical studies,and exploratory drilling 1979-1981 (Van Leeuwen, 1994). The exploration program identified a zone of anomalous copper concentrations in a 5 km long and 1-2 km wide zone of altered, fractured, and leached porphyry stock (Van Leeuwen and others, 1987). The Tangse deposit is hosted in a zone of intrusive and volcanic rocks localized by the northwest-trending Sumatran Fault zone, that traverses the length of Sumatra. Cu-Mo mineralization is hosted in a multiphase quartz diorite stock; alteration and mineralization occurred 13-9 Ma. Although early potassic alteration (biotite), overprinted by phyllic alteration (sericite-quartz) and associated sulfide mineralization, in turn overprinted/surrounded by propylitic alteration (chlorite-epidote-carbonate) is continuous in the overall deposit area, subeconomic to economic copper grades are irregular in distribution and the deposit has not been mined.

It is composed of the East and West zones which represent two coeval hydrothermal centers within a single system. The West zone extends from surface to ~500-m depth and is centered on four small granodiorite plutons emplaced into flysch, diorite, and granodiorite sills, and alkalic intrusions and breccias. The much higher grade East zone extends to at least 1,700-m depth and is hosted by a larger granodiorite pluton and adjacent granodiorite sills and flysch. The granodiorite plutons merge with depth. On the east side of the deposit, high-grade mineralization has been dropped 600 to 900 m into the NE-trending East graben, where the deposit remains undelineated to the east and to depth.The large size and high hypogene grades of the Pebble deposit may reflect a combination of multiple stages of metal introduction with vertically restricted, lateral fluid flow induced by hornfels aquitards in flysch (Lang and others, 2013). Pebble contains the largest gold resource of any known porphyry. Molybdenite at Pebble is enriched in rhenium (averaging 906 ppm); pyrite in pyrophyllite alteration zones contains up to 3 ppm palladium. The mineralization was accompanied by several types of alteration (prehydrothermal hornfels, deep sodic-calcic, potassic, sodic-potassic, illite, advanced argillic, qsp halo, propylitic). As of November, 2010, the resources of the Pebble prospect had been calculated at 4 levels of copper-equivalent cut-off (CuEQ) (Ghaffari and others, 2011; Pebble Partnership, 2010). The measured and indicated mineral resources at the lowest report cutoff grade (0.3% CuEQ) are reported as 5,942 Mt at 0.42% Cu, 0.35 g/t Au, and 250 ppm Mo.

Mineralization is in a zone about one mile long along Ptarmigan Creek. Sparse molybdenite occurs in quartz veins scattered through the granodiorite; in places, the veins are numerous enough to form a stockwork in the granodiorite; individual veins are a few inches to more than 2 ft in thickness. The molybdenite deposit was discovered in 1914 by Frank Gillespie, who explored it between 1914 and 1918; he drove drifts as much as 30 ft long. The prospect was active again from 1937 to 1940.
